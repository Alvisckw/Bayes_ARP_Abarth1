1,Prospective Buyer Questions,Track11T,"Howdy!
 As the title says Im a prospective buyer and Im actually going to the dealership Monday to test drive a 2013 Abarth with ~45k miles (12k is the asking price).

Im super excited because reviews I?€?ve seen for the car are pretty positive, but I wanted to ask you experts: What should I look for on the test drive? What things should I inspect and look out for on the car itself when I check it out? What do you wish you had known about before you bought your Abarth?

14,Multiair actuator advice,Little_Nubbly,"Might be long, sorry. My 2013 Abarth 500 started leaking oil and I threw code P106A. Put more oil in it, light didn't go away, so got it towed to the dealership for diagnosis. ""Multiair actuator has internal failure."" $2100 part + $1600 labor.

I called around to other shops to see if I could find a better price, but after calling 10+ different shops, they all gave me some variation of ""no."" Mostly, ""We don't have the special tool"" or ""we've never dealt with this system before.""

Only one shop told me they had experience in this area, but they advised me against replacing the actuator. Apparently, they've seen a pattern where replacing the multiair actuator eventually ends up causing the engine to drop a valve. They've replaced 2 engines that had recent multiair actuator replacements done at a dealership. I was advised to take it to CarMax to get a cash offer if it still drives.

Has anyone had a multiair actuator replaced and had a similar failure? Or any multiair success stories? Looking for a glimmer of hope.",9,3,0,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/15hcr2f/multiair_actuator_advice/,1691089353,15hcr2f
15,2013 Abarth 500 - Running Rich,Postmyllone,"Hey guys, here on behalf of my buddy with a 13?€? Abarth 500. He has a catless down pipe and no muffler, just straight pipe. 

We are currently trying to trouble shoot his options for fixing his AFR.

 He?€?s getting 14-15mpg average city with a peak average of 17.6mpg highway. 

The smell of fuel is never far when he is around, you can see the fuel waves blowing out the exhaust, and every start up it blows fumes. 

He also has the CEL code for his O2 sensors (just replaced the down stream and it seem to help in the slightest bit.)

What are our options? I?€?m familiar with diesel tuning as I have a TDI. For us, it?€?s as simple as a flash tune. Is it the same story here? I don?€?t see why not, as he should be able to take advantage of the higher flow for ATLEAST some small horsepower and mileage gains. 

I also suggested the idea of going to a high flow catback exhaust to help gain some of that back pressure, but he doesn?€?t want to sacrifice the noise so any ?€?noiser?€? suggestions are appreciated.

17,2022 Abarth 595 Comp turbo issues,kettleboiler,"Hi all. I?€?m not a mechanic, but my UK 595 Competizione lost power yesterday, after about an hour of driving. It was running fine. It was in Sport mode, I turned at a junction and put my foot down and it felt sluggish and wouldn?€?t pull hard. The car is now running as if it has no turbo. It will accelerate and drive around town, but doesn?€?t have the boost to accelerate quickly. It had its first service back in May and has now only just done 10,000 miles. I?€?ve called the dealership and they can get it in next week to take a look.
I saw something small bounce along the road behind me in the mirror when I first lost boost, so I did a walk down that stretch of road and I found 2 items that may or may not be from my car. Maybe it was a coincidence and I simply happened to flick something off the road under my tyres. The intake hose on the turbo still has the hose clip fitted, but the hose I s loose. I can wiggle the pipe off the turbo. I don?€?t know if that will affect the boost. The boost gauge on the car dash is zero and doesn?€?t twitch when accelerating. There are no warning lights on the dash. Without removing anything under the bonnet, I can?€?t see anything disconnected or obviously missing. I?€?ve not got a car jack, but I?€?ve got down and had a look beneath the car and can?€?t see anything obviously out of place under the car either. No fluid leaks. Anybody got any thoughts?

\- either showing a measured boost from a sensor (located in the chargepipe from sources I read)  
\- either showing what the ECU is targetting (most people are saying that)

I would prefer it to be measuring boost for a better monitoring. Requested boost won't tell you when you have small boost leak for example.

45,Bizarre electrical issues,irescueducks,"


FIXED
----------
it was the battery. Swapped the battery for a new one, everything is back to normal.

If your Abarth's electrical starts to feel haunted, coupled with a slightly worse engine start, it's probably the battery.
----------


Original post:


* Engine cranks over 9 times or more until it starts, sometimes won't even start at first key at all. This feels like there's no spark or gas coming in. But then it starts up just fine. It starts easier when warm but still struggles much more than usual.

* Trunk sometimes remains locked with car unlocked

* Seatbelt warning bell comes on as soon as you start the car, no longer waits for the car to move. Again, sometimes.

These are random occurences but they seem to correlate: i.e. when the engine doesnt start on first key, the rest of the issues i described are bound to show up.

Tried to reset the ECU, not reset but cold reboot i guess by disconnecting the battery for 20 minutes and pressing the brake pedal for 20 seconds.

The dashboard clock didn't reset, which i've been told is an indication the ECU didn't ""reset"".

This collection of strange random symptoms started all of a sudden, the only event i can correlate with is a PDR dent removal in the driver's door, where they had to inflate a bag to get the metal lever in alongside the window. Couls that be the cause? A short in the door wiring making the ECU go haywire? They didn't use anything sharp but who knows how delicate the door wiring is...",7,2,0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/158kalv/bizarre_electrical_issues/,1690226714,158kalv

64,2013 Abarth 500,Postmyllone,"What?€?s up guys, 

I come to you on behalf of a friend who owns a 2013 Abarth 500.  From my knowledge, and I will be checking this out tomorrow, he is full straight pipe. This barth is now running very lean. It blows fumes, it seems to choke as if it?€?s not burning enough fuel while driving, and the smell of fuel is never far with his car around. His biggest concern is losing the noise of his vehicle.

What are his realistic best options from here? Seems to me these are flash tune based tuners (I?€?m familiar with this as I have a Golf TDI with a stage 2 inbound). Is there a particular company that?€?s popular in this community and could solve these issues? Maybe even take advantage of the higher flow for some HP gain?

If not would a high flow catted down pipe help solve the issue but retain the sound?

122,2010 Abarth 500 1.4 T-Jet misfiring when idling.,PlayerInTheNorth,"Hi all,
I got my Abarth a couple of weeks ago (posted a pic here) and a couple days after buying it I noticed an engine misfire on cold start+flashing CEL.

So I had 4 new spark plugs installed + 2 new ignition coils (as per my mechanic?€?s recommendation). Sadly that did not fix the issue. 

Next, I went to an LPG specialist to get the LPG system tuned. (Yes, it has LPG, previous owner installed it). After tuning the LPG system the misfire on cold start no longer occurs. 

Now there is a slight occasional misfire noise coming from the exhaust pipe after driving the car hard and letting it idle. I think it only does this when running on LPG (not 100% sure). The car is currently with my mechanic again to confirm whether it is an LPG issue or not.

In the meantime I figured I?€?d ask you guys if any of you have had similar experiences and what you did to solve the problem. 

Any advice and opinions are appreciated!",0,3,0,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/14lzdja/2010_abarth_500_14_tjet_misfiring_when_idling/,1688027494,14lzdja

128,Low Grumbling Sound and Coolant Leak :/,Sad-Blueberry4896,"I realize asking to diagnose phantom noises without being able to hear them yourself is a bit of shot in the dark, but I figured I?€?d see if anyone here has encountered a similar issue.

I just had the AC system in my Abarth replaced, and when I went to pick it up, pulling out of the shop parking lot I immediately hear a low grumbling sound from the front end. It sort of sounds like induction noise. First thing I did was pull over and check my intake hoses. All looked ok there so I called the shop and let them know what was going on.

I bring it back the next day and the mechanic tells me they aren?€?t sure what?€?s going on with the noise, but that I do have a coolant leak. They noticed me low on coolant when it came in (I had fluids done a few months prior so this was odd) and topped it up, but when I came in it was low again. This was a Friday so they topped me up again, said to drive it a bit over the weekend and check the levels regularly.

I?€?ve done about 100 miles now and I?€?m at the minimum coolant level again, so the leak is pretty bad. The sound is still present and seems to be coming from the right side of the front end near the firewall. It increases with revs, but only while moving. Stationary revs don?€?t trigger it. I?€?ve tried turning the ac off in case it was related, but that didn?€?t change anything. 

Any ideas?

Edit: Looks like I got lucky, it was just a crack in the reservoir itself. I doubt that will fix my noise, so that I?€?ll still have to try and track down.

Thank you in advance for your help, and for a great sub that is super helpful for newbies. 

I?€?m in the U.S. and am thinking about buying a 500 Abarth for my daily driver (12-25 miles total every work day plus errands). In poking around the web for info, I saw a comment that the 2012 and 2013 years were a lot more problematic than other years. 

Is that true? Should I avoid those years? 

I know that having a proper maintenue history is super important, but most of them I am seeing have gaps between servicing that are so large it seems likely someone was just doing their own oil changes. Would you pick a 2012/13 with more complete records over another year with gaps in the maintenance record? 

I?€?m definitely having a prepurchase inspection, I?€?m just trying to narrow down my search some. 

Also, there is one that is attractive but it?€?s an automatic. How much does the automatic negatively impact the fun factor in these?

For some reason I keep getting the hill start unavailable/esc unavailable warning messages along with my esc light on and check engine light on. The only code that comes up when I scan it is a ""Brake Switch B Circuit"" P0703 code. I recently got a new battery in hopes that it would fix it, but the problem still comes and goes. Sometimes, it'll go away for a couple hours and then come back on and sometimes it'll be off when I turn the car on but then come back on moments later. I've had a couple instances of where it's gone away for so long that the check engine light turns off, but it is rare for that to happen. As I was just driving, I had a nice gentlemen let me know that even though he could tell I was braking, he couldn't see my brake lights turning on. My lights weren't on and I know for a fact they work when the lights are on. If anyone has any advice on what I should check out/replace I would greatly appreciate it, as I really don't want to take it to a dealership or fiat specialist and pay an arm and a leg to be able to get it diagnosed.

I'd do the backorder, I just don't want to get caught in their infinite cycle of ""delay another 45+ days, delay another 45+ days, ...., delay another 45+ days"" until I decide to just get a refund and then get put thru the ringer of trying to get my refund from them (a horror story I read from someone else).

197,New Abarthist! Should I mod it?,Crucco,"Hi all! Tomorrow I am going to take a big step and order my first Abarth (595 1.4 T-jet 165cv). I have driven Fiat 500s for two decades, but I've always loved the Abarth: sound, speed, look and feels.  


I have always heard that many Abarth owners however are not satisfied with the basic configuration and opt to perform some ""tuning"" of the car. I have looked in my area, and there are a few car tuners who offer services such as engine boosting, gear remapping, et cetera (I am not familiar with the terms, sorry). The purpose of these mods is either to increase horse power and speed, or to decrease fuel consumption.  


What is your opinion? Should I start thinking about modding my Abarth, or should I wait a few months to see what I need? Is there some book I should read first? Is it true that these mods can also reduce fuel consumption?

I am speaking on behalf of my best friend. He owns a Fiat Grande Punto 1.4 16v 95hp. I do not know about the first registration but its probably around 2010. 

He wants to swap the stock engine for an Abarth one ( my guess is from the punto series ).

Questions we both have : 

* What else does he need besides the engine ? (Main Issue)
* Can he only swap it with Abarth from the Punto series ?
* How much will it approx cost ? (We live in EU , Greece)

That's our main issues. A bit of info for the condition of the car.

His brother and him drove 300k km on it , about 200k were redlined and im being dead serious. As everyone forseen the engine is slowly dying as I'm typing this. He changed the transmission 3 times already. It's not tuned , he's only using a BMC cone filter, a Sprintbooster (for better throttle response) and better suspension. We wanna keep the car , we grew up on it so don't say it's not worth it please. 

Thanks in advance, I'll be back if it's actually done to post about it!

As I drive around it goes away and comes back during the drive. It will flash on and off for a few seconds at a time. Then it will sometimes stay on, or sometimes go back off.

Had anyone had a similar issue? I have not heard the pump running since this issue began, but the car could have not been within the parameters for it to run. 


I checked the fuses and believe that everything is as it should be. 

I worry that the pump should be running and isn't, even when the car shuts down without the error on screen. 

Any help is appreciated. 

Thanks

272,595 Comp. MAP Errors,sceptic-al,"I'm having an intermittent problem with a UK spec. 2017 595c Competizione with 20,000 miles. I started to get a check engine light error, which was diagnosed as ""P0106 Manifold Absolute"". The MAP sensor was then replaced under warranty.

Everything was okay for a few weeks after the MAP replacement, but I've started to get the same error, which I can clear using a cheapo OBDII tool. 

I've noticed that if I make a number of short trips, like under 10 minutes, I'm very likely to see the error. When it happens, I've also noticed that the idling becomes really rough, where the engine sounds like it's about to stall. Switching off the A/C and lights seem to lighten the load enough to maintain a regular idle.

  
The OBDII freeze frame data seems to show that the error occurs during cranking at 200 rpm with VPWR = 10.520v. 

Under normal conditions, the turbo gauge shows good pressure right up to the red zone (1.75 bar). VPWR typically shows around 14v.

I've seen a few posts that suggest the persistent P0106 errors could be related to the battery condition, which seems feasible given the short distances. The battery looks to be only 2-3 years old.

278,What should I know before buying?,Mephisto_Mods,"Hi guys, I'm new to this sub and I've joined because I've been thinking about buying a 695C for a few weeks now, but I'm not sure. Let me explain (please note english is not my first language):

\- I'm European (BE), and as far as new cars go, there's no fun compact anymore except Abarth. The VW Polo exists in GT (or GTI?) but it is now as big as a Golf, same for the ford Fiesta... the Renault Twingo doesn't exist anymore, etc... If you got sugestions for others small funs I've missed, feel free to tell me in the comments  
\- I always loved looking at small cars with a ""special thing"" (2CV, original beetle, Fiat 500, etc.) never driven one tho...  
\- With the political push to electric in europe, despite the lack of infrastructure in my country, I'm not sure there's much time to lose before all fun gas car dissapear

so enough context, here are the big questions I've got for the moment:

I'm not a ""under the hood"" king of guy. I tend to just drive and go to the official dealer once a year for the check up. If you don't mess with the defaults parts and settings, and service it at the official dealer, is it a reliable car?

I'm thinking going ""all in"" an go for the 695C (180HP + Cabrio) but I'm having second thoughts about the cabrio part. The car will sleep on the street, and I plan to keep it for a long time cause it will be my family's second car (the sunday pleasure one) and less used one. Do you think the fabric of the retractable roof would endure 10+ years of exterior? Should I play it safe and go for the non cabrio version?

Is there any special thing I need to know before entering the Abarth word (culturally or from a mechanical standpoint) ?",5,1,0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/13k3lbz/what_should_i_know_before_buying/,1684334253,13k3lbz

281,Average maintenance cost for Abarth 500?,kingelizabeth_,"I've been looking at buying my first car. Reliability is important to me... (making decent money as a student living alone) I do not want to spend thousands a month on maintenance but I also want to drive a car that make me happy. Im absolutely in love with the retro look of a fiat interior. I'm a pretty small person so I felt the small car would be a good fit for me, especially as a newer driver. Of course everyone Ive talked to (none of whom have owned a fiat) go on and on about how I should just get a Toyota or Honda instead. I've just been looking at used Fiats on the side.

I think I found a pretty good dealer considering the car market right now. A glossy red 2015 Fiat 500 Abarth Hatchback, for 9500, with 76,000 miles on. 2 owners. Visually it looks very well taken care of. I don't know much about cars and I haven't gone to see the fiat yet, but plan to in a few days. I have to take a trip across the country soon, I plan on driving it 2,000 miles with stops. It just seems like a hit or miss with these cars from what I've read.

285,battery dying overnight 0.2A draw from radio/climate fuse,dZisky,"Hi all, I have an ongoing problem of locating a power draw in my 595C. One battery died on me, I thought because it was old so I bought a new one and then I saw a voltage dropping on a new one overnight too. So after loads of searching, I found out that the draw is coming from fuse F36 which is described as ""Diagnostic Socket, Car Radio, Climate Control System"". I did install Android head unit so I immediately thought this was an obvious reason, but when I disconnected the unit completely the voltage was still dropping overnight (from \~12.6 after turning the car off after drive to \~11.8 in the morning). When I remove fuse F36 overnight the voltage stays perfectly at 12.6 overnight. I checked with multimeter and that connection when fuse F36 is, is drawing 0.2A when car is off and with android unit disconnected (and nothing connected to the radio cables). So it must be something related to climate control or ""diagnostic socket"" whatever that is. Any ideas? The only other thing I need to check is that I had Monza exhaust installed and controlled by a 3rd party vacuum flap controller which was installed by a garage so there is high chance that this controlled is drawing that power but I couldn't see where it's cables are going when I was checking.",8,1,0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/13hdtkw/battery_dying_overnight_02a_draw_from/,1684074881,13hdtkw
286,2015+ vs 2014 and older 500 Abarths,rand0mL0gix,"I would like to buy a 500 Abarth and wanted to know everyone?€?s thoughts about the 2014 and older Abarths vs the 2015 and newer ones. When buying cars in general, I would typically buy the later model year. However, there are more electronics in the 2015+ Abarths. I am wondering I will have less headaches buying a 2014 or older model which has fewer electronics (i.e., analog speedo, no backup sensors, etc.). 

I saw a 2017 in my area that drives fine but has the flashing odometer issue and the compass in the radio cannot acquire a signal. I don?€?t mind the compass, but after looking online, the flashing odometer could be caused by a bad battery or one of the modules in the canbus can be malfunctioning. I don?€?t want to buy a used Abarth and need to replace (a potentially expensive) module.

However with the coming car tax in my country, plus regular repairs, and electrical malfunctions, I have found out it is a bit too much for me to keep. 

I'm thinking of selling the S, but when I check the market, there's literally nothing that I really like. That was until I was watching ""The Italian Job"" (1969), which featured Fiat a lot. The next day I started googling Fiat models (I had never done that before, since I have driven German cars only), and I stumbled upon the **ABARTH 500**, and now it is **my new obsession.**

Like really - I have been shopping around for like an Audi A6 all-road or something, but no car has character - they're all safe, and boring. I'm looking to get one for 4000-7000??? tops (including import expenses, North-Europe)

296,Has Anyone Had to Replace Their AC System?,Sad-Blueberry4896,"Fresh off the transmission replacement, and just in time for summer, my abarth decided to stop blowing cold air. I took it to a popular shop in my area and they?€?re quoting me 3k to replace the whole system. Apparently the compressor had a blown fuse, but replacing it did not fix the issue. They?€?re saying it?€?s leaking around the expansion valve, and the compressor has an internal failure. They want to replace the whole system.

Just taking a look online I can find all of these parts for around $400 total. There?€?s obviously labor costs + recharge and everything too, but 3k seems insane to me. And this was after them knocking some off to ?€?do me a favor.?€? I told them I was going to get another opinion. Does anyone have any experience with this? What did it cost you?
