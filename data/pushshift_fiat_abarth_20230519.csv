23,Coolant Leak on Seicento,T1m0nst3r,"Hi All,

Day 2 of Fiat ownership going well! I had a coolant leak today that I could not find the source of? The car was running perfectly with no leaks on the drive when I left, running at normal temperatures for about a 20 min drive until I got to my destination and steam started coming from the bonnet when I reversed up a slope to park. I also checked under the oil cap and did not see any milky residue in fear of a head gasket going. -I should also mention that the engine runs really excellent, idles stably, starts up instantly.

This happened at 5 o'clock on a Sunday so I had nowhere to find coolant so I topped up the tank with Mineral water ( could not have been more than 500ml) and the car ran normally on the drive home.

Between the incident and me topping up the tank there were no spots left on the ground?

I will take the car in for a check up as I have not had it up on a ramp yet.

Just thought I should post in case anybody has had similar experiences/ advise.

32,Major mechanical question: abnormally loud noise?,Commie-Procyon-lotor,"A couple weeks ago, I noticed that my 2013 Abarth (manual transmission), would have some sort of loud droning noise that spikes up in volume at intervals. I can hear it slightly at 35 miles per hour, then it would be twice as loud at 55 MPH, and it would sound up again at 75 MPH but isn't as loud as 55. So I assumed I had uneven wear on my rear tires since I heard it closer to the rear.

I went to a shop to have my tires rotated and rebalanced, and I still hear this droning towards the rear. I even noticed that as I accelerate from 50 to 60, the sound ""rolls"" from underneath the seat to the rear.

This droning noise even happens while I'm out of gear and the engine is at 1000RPM in highway speed and I don't hear sputtering/popping at all, so I don't think this is an exhaust leak.

At one point my cluster heads up display used to show psi sensors of each tire.

Randomly one day now it doesn't show it.

I can't seem to figure out how to change any of the options of the cluster display in front of my wheel.

It only has a couple of options of trip, and dimmer.

I recall in the past one could reset the tire sensors too.

I found more options in the radio, but it's mainly for units of measurements, for distance, pressure or other things, but not what I used to have.

The manual mentions something about having the car off and opening the door, but nothing happens.

It seems like I am in some sort of limited mode and cannot change the options.

For it having been serviced less than a month before, the levels were quite low, but just thought I'd keep an eye on it.


A couple of days ago I checked the oil levels, after getting a low oil pressure warning that disappeared within seconds, and there was barely any oil in it, so I took it to the garage and I have been told that there's no leaks. They think that it needs a specific type of oil, and that if it's not the right one, the engine burns it. Does this sound right? I'm not very knowledgeable in cars as I've been driving for only 3 months now. 

I read into it before I heard back from the mechanic, could be the pistons or a seal leak and I was terrified of the cost to repair, but this seems pretty minor in comparison.

107,Just wanted to post this somewhere because I resolved it. FIAT 500 No Crank/No Start,_UsUrPeR_,"Hey all. I just finished fixing my mother-in-law's Fiat 500. It was having intermittent starting problems, and I wasted a bunch of time and money on it, but have finally resolved the problem.

Vehicle:

   * 2012 Fiat 500 Sport - 150,000 miles
   * Manual 5-speed transmission
   * 1.4L engine

Symptoms:

Intermittent start, no start. Battery seemed to be good, but vehicle would not crank, no starter engage, no solenoid click.

Resolution:

First, I replaced the starter, presuming that the intermittent start was caused by its age. This seemed to temporarily resolve the issue, which reappeared the next month.

Second, I checked the ground strap from body to transmission. It appeared to be on the verge of failure, so I purchased two battery cables from Autozone - one I ran to replace the original strap from the body to the transmission (which required the removal of the clutch slave cylinder. Reminder: keep some tension on the slave with a zip tie, or it will pop out, and you'll have to bleed the clutch). Still no luck on starting.

Finally, I followed the hint of jumping out the clutch switch detailed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uze9mUXP33c). This was the resolution: the clutch switch relay had failed. I jumped out the relay with a piece of wire just like in the video, and the vehicle starts just fine now. I realize that the video shows an Abarth, but the clutch switch relay is in the same location.

Problem solved! I am purchasing a new clutch switch relay, but in the mean time, everything is working just fine!

Some details:
-engine temp gauge doesn’t show overheating so assume it’s not coolant
-it happens so much that if it were a fluid leak of some sort, I’d assume whatever is actually leaking would eventually be so low that the system would fail, like power steering or coolant
-smoke burns white
-when we close all the vents and turn off air while driving it smokes less, but still happens. This mostly prevents the the smoke smell from entering cabin
-the frequency it occurs is increasing. used to only happen once or twice a month when it started, but now it’s almost every drive

125,AC troubles for our beloved Fiat 500L - Fiat can't supply part.,realpixelriffic,"The AC failed in our 500L last September, so we took her in to the local dealer.  They kept telling me the ""part was on order"" but no other info.  I picked the car up after no results for six weeks.  The part still remains on order, as of last Friday.  My wife and I love this car, but Central texas summers would make it a nightmare without AC.  I have also tried to order it from numerous online sellers to no avail.  

The part is a suction hose number 68201912AA.  If anyone else has some insight, or a line on parts, it would be greatly appreciated.

When I check with Chrysler it is about $750 CAD for the part. If it's anything like my balljoint, it's grossly overpriced there. They wanted almost $1000 to fix it (about $850 for the part)and I got the part online for $70. There are no Fiat dealers anywhere near me.

Some cars I have seen for  the first time in my life, others I have seen a  number of times, but  mostly only by passing by. Unfortuantely the weather wasn't the best,  but it was the most fun I've  had in months. I met and talked to a lot  of people and hope to do that  in the near future again.

221,Need Fiat Panda engine/electronic help,medi_dat,"I recently bought a Fiat Panda 2013 1.2 Pop Hatchback which I do enjoy driving. However, it's had a recurring issue with it where if I try to go to 70mph or sit at around 2,800 - 3000 RPM it cuts out into limp mode.

When I take it to the garage the diagnostics report always shows up with a misfire on cylinder 1 and 4 and most recently an overheating warning on a rainy day.

When I turn the lights on I also get a warning saying that the rear right registration plate light is out even though I recently replaced it and know it works, that warning goes off eventually too

What have I had changed/fixed on it?New Spark PlugsNew Spark Plug LeadsNew Timing BeltNew Water PumpEntire engine has been retimedNew fuel/oil adjustment valueMissing grounding on the ECU port so a grounding wire has been attached

The replacement of the adjustment value fixed the issue for about 150-200 miles before it happened again. Now I can't reach 3000rpm again without the same issue.

Have any of you had this before or noticed this as an issue?

EDIT: I changed the coil pack and cleared the error codes which seems to have fixed the issue. ",9,6,0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/pd74yk/need_fiat_panda_engineelectronic_help/,1630145085,pd74yk

225,Let me introduce myself and my two Fiat 126p,Urban126p,"Hello,

my name is Alexander and first of all I would like to thank the moderators to allow me to be part of this group.

I am the owner of 2 Fiat 126p.  I bought my first one in 2010 and since then the car has gone through a lot of changes. Most of which were on the cosmetic side, because the car was and still is in a rather good technical shape for a car that is almost 30 years old.It is only being driven when the weather is nice.  So mostly during spring and summer. Over the colder period the car is being stored in a garage, where it is safe from the outside world ;-)

In 2015 I bought my second Fiat 126p. This is a slightly younger model from 1994 and I use this one as my daily driver. In 2016 I had it transported to Austria and since then I have driven it around 14.000km. It is a very reliable car and until now I did not have any problems with it. It was only this year, that I had to invest a little bit of money to have a few things sorted out.

At the end of 2018 I started my own Youtube channel, that is dedicated to both my Maluchs. In the last 2 and a half years I made around 115 videos. I record them in English, German and Polish. Although there have been over 4 million units produced the car doesn't have a very big following as of 2021, at least it is not being talked about as much as other cars. A lot of people know about the original Fiat 500, but rarely people recognize the Fiat 126 oder the Fiat 126p as in my case.

So I would like to invite everyone of you, to check out my channel on Youtube and hopefully you will like the videos I make.

[Urban 126p Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsgqk9Bc_MRUTHqTZdgtO3w)

Again, I would like to thank the moderators for allowing me to be part of this sub-reddit and I am looking forward to having interesting discussions with all the redditors.

Cheers,

Alex

285,What to inspect while buying an X1/9 1300 and where can I find parts for it ?,Alexandre_Wren,"Hello folks, I was searching for help regarding a Fiat X1/9. I will soon be getting my driver's license and in the search for a first car and will most likely be a classic (I have a backup car). I managed to find an X1/9 in need of some love within my budget, the seller claims that the car is rust free and is selling with a selection of small parts. I honestly grew a bit of a soft spot for these after seeing one in wheeler dealers or car SOS as a kid.

I was mostly asking for what to look for on this model excluding rust, I have some experience with classics and know cars fairly well. Is there any particular spot or component I should give a thorough look at ?

My other concern would also be parts  as I can already tell you she will not be a garage queen and will be used all around the year as the temperature never drops below 14 celsius where I live. I will have to import parts, as such do you have any recommended website which supplies parts for it.

Is there anyway to get some sort of overdrive on the 4 speed ? I looked into the 5 speed conversion from a later model but would require swapping a LOT of parts from a newer model. I ideally would try to keep the car relatively stock, maybe some twin webers and an exhaust but nothing else really in mind.

319,How I got rid of the errors after changing my 2015 FIAT 500e 12v battery,Shift_Ctrl_Esc,"My 500e's regular 12v car battery died last year and the experience replacing it was a little different from what I found through Google so I am sharing in hopes this will help others out. This is how I got rid of my ""Service Electric Vehicle System"" ""Service Propulsion System"" and ""Limited Power Mode"" errors:

I just let it sit.

That's right. After changing the battery at AutoZone I first tried the whole turning the key 5-10x thing and that didn't work. Disconnected the battery then reconnected it, making sure it was super tight and that didn't work. Drove it down the road and, nope, still in turtle mode. Even tried the key thing again after that.

What really got it out of ""Service Electric Vehicle System"" was dinner. I'm serious. I came back to it an hour later after dinner and it had switched to the much less annoying ""Service Propulsion System"" error instead. At least THAT error doesn't limit your power. I took it for another little drive to try to get rid of that error anyway and that didn't work. So I just plugged it in and let it charge overnight and all errors were gone in the morning.

So there you go, if you change the battery and see the dreaded turtle, chances are you'll just have to let the car and the new battery have some time alone. Nothing extra that I did seemed to help, but it sorted itself out with time. It's slightly inconvenient, but that's about it. Otherwise, overall it's been a very convenient car.",1,18,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/j2fcqw/how_i_got_rid_of_the_errors_after_changing_my/,1601439926,j2fcqw

Hope you are well!

I recently bought a 2012 Fiat Qubo with an engine start stop function.

As I've never owned an automatic car with that function posting here for some clarification.

When I'm braking to a stop, the engine stops and starts immediately after, without me depressing the brakes.

Is that how the start stop works in this car? I would expect it to keep the engine from running for as long as I'm braking.

343,Fiat 500x Back hatch handle(button),lordduzzy,"I wanted to post this somewhere online for anyone that might run into this problem in the future regarding the 2016 Fiat 500x Lounging where the back handle stops working or falls apart. 

After doing some research I was able to see that the design of the back handle wasn't fantastic, and several people have had their entire handle/rubber trunk button cover fall off. When this happens, there is not a trunk release inside. However, once the rubber button cover is removed(or fell off like for me), there are two metal contact points that are exposed (pretty difficult to see if the door is shut). If you connect the two wires with something metal, the trunk will release. I have included a picture of the underside, where you can see where the wires are located.

When it comes to replacing the handle for the back hatch, it can only be ordered as a single piece at around $500 from the dealer and 350 online(part number 6RF71U00AA). That part includes the entire silver bar with the backup camera, license plate lights, etc. In order to swap that part, you just need to open the door, remove the panel, then it's just a few screws and deal with navigating around the emblem. Overall it's not terribly hard to fix, but a few hundred I would have been fine with out spending. I only wanted it out there because I couldn't find an actual resolution anywhere, and wanted it for the next person.",3,12,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/hw0rkk/fiat_500x_back_hatch_handlebutton/,1595447556,hw0rkk

348,500 Abarth reliability?,carlizzlemynizl,"Hi gang,

I'm looking to trade my old truck for a new, snappy, fun, inexpensive little car, and obviously, my first choice (and dream car) is the 500 Abarth (nero puro exterior, rosso interior.) It's $10k with 65k miles, and it looks like it's in great shape. The only thing I worry about is the reliability. Fiat-Chrysler isn't exactly known for their reliability, like the Japanese are, for example, and I worry that the price I pay for the car now is going to come back to bite me in the future with service costs.

Also, I also understand that the reason people buy Abarths is for the exhaust porn, but as this would be my primary car, I'm a groom at a horse barn and I worry that the engine starting would scare the horses. Do you guys think the engine is louder than that of an average big work truck? and if so, is there any temporary fix I can put on that? (sorry I'm not much of a car person)

thanks for all your help!

351,"Engine Problems (Abarth, please help!)",Squabbles123,"Hello, I'm seeking any knowledge or advice about what to do with my 2015 Fiat 500 Abarth.   I totally love the car, I have some attachment to it, and it may have just died and I'm really hoping I can find someone on here that may give me something to try before I give up hope and am forced to basically scrap the car.  

So, its 5 years old, 59k miles, but been my daily driver for those 5 years, mostly to work, recently my miles have really increased and about 10k of those are in the past 3-4 months alone.   During that time I had something weird happen, all the dash lights lit up and went a bit weird, the car actually shut off for a split second, then turned itself back on, and resumed like nothing happened, all while in motion, that was like a month ago.

This issue:  I was driving home yesterday and I go to press the gas, immediately I notice no real response, no boost, and my exhaust note has changed to sound like it has some kinda sputter.  My boost gauge is moving, but can't be right as I have no power.   I pull off, and when the car is idle is really low RPMs, like 700, pressing the gas from this results in a lot of vibration and low power response.    I manage to limp the car home, but something is very wrong.

There is no longer a Fiat dealership in my area, the nearest to me is well over an hour away, I pick a local repair shop with a good reputation, but probably little personal knowledge of my engine.  **Error code P301, no compression in cylinder 1.**   I have them check the coil, the vaccum seal, spark plugs, everything, they even remove the entire intake manifold so they can look at the piston itself.  Everything they attempt, including some kinda ""oil test"" with the piston still results a tiny bit of compression which fades into no compression quickly.   They still haven't been able to actually SEE a problem, everything from the eye looks fine, but...no compression.   They are convinced it has to be something in the bottom of the motor, like the crank or that the rings on the piston might have gone blown.  

They're only advice for repair is replace the engine at this point as they can't find the cause without basically taking the entire engine apart.  

Does ANYONE have any ideas what this could be?  Anything I should have checked that might not have been checked already?  Anything at all?   I'm desperate at this point, I love this car, its not even paid off yet, and I'd like to avoid having to buy a new car so I can get back to work.   Please help.   Thank you.

396,Thinking about a 2014 500L,Scotty1300,"Don’t know if this sub likes these sorts of posts, but I’m looking at getting a new-to-me used car. I saw a 500L Trekking for sale, and I was really drawn to all the windows (it has the sunroof and everything). It looks really comfortable, and has some decent power (1.4I4 Turbo model), and it’s big enough for me. I’m a tiny single dude, I don’t need a huge car, I’d make a smart car look like a Camry. 

My only concern is reliability. I’ve heard the jokes, and so have you so I won’t repeat it, but I want to know how true this is. If it’s just spark plugs and filters I have to worry about that’s fine. I can do those myself. But if it’s gonna have problems with the transmission (the one I found is an auto) or the turbo, I have no expertise in those areas. Also I live in a place with lots of dirt roads, I don’t want to be eating through axles and wheel bearings. 

Will this car become a headache I can’t afford to drive, or will it be on par with most other cars on the road? I want to finance the car too, to build credit, but I don’t want to be making payments on a car that keeps needing repairs.

Fiat Ritmo Abarth Gen. 1  
Fiat Ritmo Abarth Gen. 2  
Fiat Uno Turbo (Abarth had their hand in it, but not their name on it)  
And then lastly, a totally forgettable bland Fiat, I can't even remember the name (Punto?)

With exception of the first and the last, I had a blast with each and every one of them...

As far as the 500 Abarth here in the US, I am doing my research, but is there anything that is a known issue that would make buying the Abarth a deal breaker?

   I'm normally a Mazda fan but can't find one with a manual transmission for a price I can afford at this time.  So I came across a 5 speed 2013 500 Abarth, almost in mint condition,  new tires,  for $8925.
   I took a test drive today and it was crazy fun. The car looks great,  whips around corners, I'm on board to buy.  But you lovely people are the experts, is the price right?  Any fixes I should look for in the near future?  I know nothing about Fiats, please help me oh wise ones!

How does the 500 feels on the highway? Wind noise? Suspension? High rpm @ 110km/h?

I am in the process of purchasing an automatic Fiat 500 1.2 used car 2011 model.

I am not in the country to test drive the vehicle so asked a friend to do so. His feedback was everything was good with the vehicle, but the suspension sounded a little loud going over a bump .

I am just wondering if this is just a known design issue with the car design in general or is this more specific to this vehicle.

Many thanks,

So I am thinking about doing some upgrades. I was considering turbocharging it. I know there are models that have turbos in them but I'm wanting to do some modifications myself. After some research I found that I would be cheaper to just drop a whole new engine in it that is already turbocharged. Any advice or suggestions? Would an engine that came out of a previously turbocharged fiat (Vin H) fit in a fiat 500 (Vin R)?

The individual who dropped the car off mentioned that she tried 3 different bulbs in the left rear running light and none of them would work. The brake light works normally without issue.

564,Fiat 500e Question from a first time buyer,ActuallyAshley_Duh,"Hello,

So I absolutely love the Fiat 500s and have been dreaming of the day that I can finally purchase one. Well, that day is coming much sooner than I had planned. After test driving several, I decided to also test drive a Fiat 500e. And I absolutely loved it! Now I live in the Greater Los Angeles area so there is very little concern about finding a charge station. BUT this is where my concern lies, I have a 2 hour to sometimes 3 hour commute to work every day. I live 36 miles from my place of work so I know the Electric can make it there and back with it having a 84 miles charge. However, given the reality of LA traffic is it unrealistic to think I can make the commute on one charge?
It’s not the mileage I am worried about, it’s the mileage coupled with the duration.",12,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/f6lgm5/fiat_500e_question_from_a_first_time_buyer/,1582163218,f6lgm5

I have thoroughly cleaned the inside of all of the windows.

It was so bad a month ago, I had a sheet of ice that had formed on the **inside** of the windshield, I had to use an ice scraper to get it off. Any ideas what could be the issue?

Total car noob here (haha) recently passed my test don't know too much about anything yet. My car is a Fiat Panda from 2005, Dynamic model?

I have a bit of a mystery!

Last week had my starter motor replaced at a garage. After getting it fixed we noticed the engine fan now **always** powers on once the car is started even before engine is on; wasn't something it did prior unless had done a long drive. The temperature gauge on the dashboard is also broken (unfortunately unsure whether it was previously) so am running on the theory that a lead was potentially knocked out after getting the motor replaced.

When having a look under the hood, we found a disconnected lead of an unknown source lol. This:

[Comes from the main body area surrounding the engine. Kinda hoping it might be related to the fan issue because that would be an easy fix...](https://preview.redd.it/qfpjzqjw2rf41.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=484540747a59c7b91b46868c6ae1922e3c8860fa)

Does anybody have a clue where we should be looking to plug this back in? Our searches were in vain lol, we tried so hard to find out where it came from.

Going to take it to a garage on Monday but any advice would be totally appreciated! Am stumped.

Now, it seems like the panel resets itself everytime I turn the car. Basically, it is not saving my settings that I originally had like my paired phones, saved radio stations, navigation etc.  Well, now when I drive, a voice comes out and tells me anytime Im driving over the speed limit. Its driving me crazy and Im getting annoyed at having to turn it off anytime I drive the car. 

I want to take it to fiat but they charge an arm and a leg for anything relating to the car. Has anyone experienced this before? Im not sure if this is the right outlet for it but Im desperate and somewhat turned off from the brand. I read somewhere to take off the battery for it but Fiat seems to even make that a mission and I dont believe that I have the proper tools for it. Looking for any guidance and advice.

I've tried some things out and done some searching online and haven't had any luck. It seems like the Bluetooth and USB are both meant for really specific uses like stored mp3 files or specific apps, and not for simply outputting audio from any old source.

In a worst-case scenario, I understand that I can buy either...

* a lightning adapter or splitter that would allow me to continue using 3.5 mm cable
* a Bluetooth receiver with a 3.5mm output that I could plug into the AUX input and transmit to from the phone

697,Question about whether my concerns for the timing belt on 500s are justified or not.,[deleted],"Correct me if I'm wrong on anything as this is base on my research online and I don't know any Fiat owners. 

 I wanted a Fiat 500 because its just the right size and the design is really appealing to me. But the engine having a timing belt and also being an interference engine made me worried about buying one. Supposedly it is supposed to be changed every 75,000 miles and requires special tools to replace as well as completely stripping the engine. Then there's the issue of the belt just snapping for whatever reason and destroying the engine or the timing is slightly off and the engine is destroyed.

If the engine was a non-interference engine then I wouldn't mind as much. 

Has anyone had issues with the engine using a timing belt? Is the cost to replace one very expensive?",7,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/eglfdm/question_about_whether_my_concerns_for_the_timing/,1577503307,eglfdm

Before this I had a Honda, and when it got stuck it had a place right next to P that I could stick a screwdriver in to force it to change gears.

I tried googling this feature on my car, pretty sure I've read about it, but it's not right on the top. I think it's somewhere else. Google brought up a bunch of stuff on how to drive a manual.

They told me to call Chrysler Capital, so I did, and they're telling me that they absolutely will not extend the lease unless there's a natural disaster or if I submit proof that I've arranged for a lease on a different car and that car arrives late; this is very disappointing because I'd been hoping to just do another 2-3 year lease on the car. So then I asked about negotiating the buyout given that my residual is $19k yet you can find tons of the same model year on Carfax for $9k, and they said that they absolutely will not negotiate the buyout price.

Is this really what Fiat/Chrysler Capital does? Should I try calling again and talking to someone else (or should I be talking to the finance guy at the dealership?), or do they maybe get more reasonable once you hit the 90 days mark and I'm just jumping the gun here (I'm at about 120 days from my lease ending)? I really like the car and would love to keep it for at least another few years, and very specifically don't want a bigger car, but if they won't extend my lease and won't budge on the buyout price then I don't preferable to just keep the car I already have than to go through that hassle.",11,9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/dt5ryq/my_lease_on_my_500e_is_coming_due_and_im_being/,1573166725,dt5ryq

That being said -- an NC Miata in good shape goes for similar prices to a Fiat Abarth in my area, just browsing cars.com and autotrader.

New problems: Twice my car has said ""High coolant temps, turn off engine."" Once it was right as start up, I was parked, so I did just that. And the light went away. Second time was 2-3 minutes after start up. I was driving out of a parking lot. I went to park really quick to shut my engine off. But in the span of about 45 seconds my car chugged/lagged/jerked &amp; then my dashboard went through errors again (it's had a tire sensor error for months). It was almost like it shit the engine off itself and then turned it back on. Restarted on its own. The error went away. 

Everytime I open my door the dash comes on with the time, and it stays that way for a little while. Long enough for me to get situationed normally. A few times when I go to start it now, it turns the dash off. Everything goes completely dark. Sometimes this will come with a noise sounding like my car is trying to spit out a CD that's stuck. Sometimes this noise follows with the P signal for Park flashing a couple times on my dashboard then nothing. It's all still dead. I've been able to start my car after 2-5 attempts.  

I do live in Texas, and the cold front was pretty serious to the 100+ temps we have been having, and it's been raining a lot more. 

When I checked my battery at O'Riley's it ran up bad battery, then he had me turn my car on to do a second test for my starter &amp; alternator and he said both of those are good.

848,Multiair Actuator Issue,MelancholyDick,"Howdy!

I drive a ‘13 500 Abarth that just rolled over 36,000 miles. I took it on a road trip this past weekend and the car ran fine the whole time until about halfway through the journey when the check engine light came on. A quick code read at an O’Reilly’s indicates it needs a new variable valve timing actuator. The thing is, the car had been running just fine all day. 

One thing I noticed afterwards is that it takes longer to start in the morning and hesitates to gain power if I leave too soon before the car warms up. This only seems to happen first thing in the morning after it’s been sitting all night. 

I have a few theories as to why the car ultimately runs fine and starts easier the rest of the day:

1. A dud battery (brand new from March this year).

2. Sand or dirt in the engine. I moved from New Mexico down to Florida and I suspect there is a lot of dust in the engine that I don’t quite know how to get out. 

3. Bad sensor. Does it have one? Maybe it just needs a cleaning or replacement?

Also worth noting that sometimes the check engine light disappears. I chalked this up to just a gremlin but maybe it’s worse than that. 

I really hope I don’t need to replace the whole actuator, so hopefully this ends up being minor. 

Have any of you experienced this with your 500? If so, what was the solution?",4,4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/dfopo1/multiair_actuator_issue/,1570660741,dfopo1

I am interested in test driving a 2017 Fiat 500X Trekking at a local dealership sometime this week and am hoping to gain some opinions on people with experiences with this crossover. I know nothing about Fiat’s and do not know anyone personally who has owned one. This one has 45k miles on it but looks clean in the pictures, only one owner and no accidents reported. 

I currently drive a 2014 VW Beetle, and I absolute love that car. It is super fun and has all the options I want. The big downfall is it cannot get around in the snowy winters my state has. I am wanting to get an SUV/crossover that can get around in the snow a bit with AWD. 

I love the looks of the 500X and this one I want to test drive looks like it has all the options I want. I have wanted one of these purely off of looks for awhile but they don’t show up around my area that often, let alone in my budget. 

Is it a reliable car? How is the AWD in the winter/snow? Is it worth my time to test drive? Is it worth me looking into numbers if I like how it feels when I drive it?

First gear worked, thankfully, so I pulled into a spot. While parked, I tried all the gears and when the gear lever was in 5th, I was able to move it all across the top (between gears 1, 3, and 5). Not sure if that makes sense, but I knew something was up, so I called a tow. My car repair shop doesn't open until tomorrow morning, so I won't know the details until then.

My question is, I know these cars are known for rusted frames, and generally a terrible mechanical/maintenance experience.

I can change alternators, starters, waterpumps, radiators, most electrical, etc but I cannot rebuild an engine from scratch or attempt to fix a transmission without some guided help. 

I saw the car in person and it needs some new paint, right now it's a primer looking red, and it needs a sun roof where it's a convertible. The owner has kept a tarp on it to prevent it from being rained on.

Any advice on buying this, don't buy it, caveats?

I want the car because I'd like to have a cruising around downtown car, or a night out type of car. I don't want something fast (the 124 dont usually push many horses ha), and I don't need something that takes corners super fast. I want a rear wheel drive, classic roadster like car, and I enjoy the italian name associated with it.

Thinking it to be a wheel bearing I got down on the ground to shake/inspect before taking it to a shop to lift it, only to find that I have flat spots/diagonal wear patterns all over my rear tires. The car has never been in an accident and I've owned it since 2017 when it had about 30,000 miles on it (Now at 49,000), I rotate the tires at every oil change and they are currently at 4/32nds all the way around (Close to needing new), but it only developed this noise/wear pattern within the last 2,000 miles (Since I performed a n oil change and tire rotation) and it's steadily been getting worse ever since.

I only just finished technicians training a few months ago but then switched to sales - normally flat spotting on a tire is caused by spring/shock failure, correct?

I feel as though the car is thinking the top isn't all the way up or something, so I'm thinking it's an issue with the A/C control module or some kind of sensor that detects where the top is.

1003,Thinking of joining the Fiat 500 club and have some questions.,[deleted],"Looking to buy a daily car to learn stick shift and be easy to work on. I saw a TON of Fiats out on a market with most people repeating the old ""Fix It Again Tony"" phrase. Pretty have a wide selection of mostly Pop but there are a few turbos, Abarths, and Lounges. I don't really know the difference between the Pop and Lounges except for wheels. I'm learning towards Abarth because I want a fun daily driver. 

Once I realize how cheap insurance was, I decided to save up for an Abarth 500 but if that gets sold then a red 500 Pop but I have some questions for owners.

If I have one delivered from the northern US like Indiana, Minnesota, or Virginia will it be full of rust from salt? I'm in the Gulf States so the only issue a Fiat will have is the intense hellish heat. Don't want to deal with rust that have eaten way the frame and floorboards. 

How good is the Abarth or Pop as a daily driver? It'll mostly be on highways and rural roads. I intend to follow maintenance schedules and keep everything in top shape which is why I'm getting a small car. Smaller cars are easier to take apart and have smaller parts that are cheaper.

Last thing, what should I watch out for when buying one in the 80-110k range? I'm aware of the timing belt but should I expect a lemon if the previous owners only did an oil change? 

Hopefully I can get a daily driver 500.

* Never going to take it to the track so I do not need super high performance tires (I almost never exceed 100 mph so I do not need Z rated tires)
* The car is essentially stock with stock Lusso rims so there are no additional things to worry about (like if the suspension was lowered or anything like that)

1043,500 owners - Can we make a list of the most frequent rattles we have found and our solutions to them?,GingerBeardedEditor,"I love my 500, but know that many of them are prone to excessive noises/ rattles. I have been able to find a few posts here and there on multiple forums, but creating a ""**rattle index**"" might not be such a bad idea. I'll start with a few of my finds and solutions (1,2, and 3), and a few I found on other forums.

**Rattle 1**

* Problem: Encountering a rattle in the back whenever I drive over a large bump
* Solution: Easy - it turns out my license plate was just bumping around, I added two extra screws to the bottom to secure it and the problem disappeared.

**Rattle 2**

* Problem: Rattle coming from the dash or behind the steering wheel at multiple RPMs.
* Solution: Moderate - This one was a little tougher to track down. Whenever I pushed on the front of the dash left to my steering wheel the sound would stop. After popping it off, I couldn't find anything loose, but the problem persisted. After a few more tests of applying pressure in certain areas, it turns out the it was the top right screw in the display mounting. To fix this (if I remember correctly) it only really took removing the two screws underneath the steering wheel, popping off the plastic enclosure, and maybe unscrewing two more screws that were holding on the front panel's trim. Sure enough, that top right bolt holding the panel in, had loosened from its thin shitty ""nut"" (similar to what you'd find in an electrial outlet the little square paper thin pieces of metal). I replaced it with a new small bolt and REAL nut, and the problem has never persisted.

**Rattle 3**

* Problem: Rattling coming from passenger and driver doors.
* Solution: Easy - Removed interior door covers and carefully removed noise reduction lining. Tightened all bolts that had been shook loose and applied Loctite Blue 242 (the hand tool removable stuff)  to prevent future issues with vibrations.

**Rattle 4**

* Problem: LOUD rattle in passenger door.
* Solution: Easy - turns out it was just the passenger safety belt hitting against the door.

EDIT - all added rattles from comments

**Rattle 5**

* Problem:  Rear headrests tend to vibrate/rattle at specific rpm's, typically idle/low.
* Temporary Solution: ""Smack the shit out of it until it stops""
* Solution: Pending further investigation

By no means will this replace you going to a mechanic, and if you're not handy when it comes to cars, play it safe and get it serviced. But I personally like doing most of the work on my fiat, oil changes, brake changes, strut/shock replacement, etc, so finding and fixing these rattles is something I'm constantly trying to do myself.

We recently bought a new Fiat Tipo sw (1.4 petrol) . I can't help but notice the enormous gap between the first and the second gear. 
When you shift like one normally would, it seems like the engine can't pull the car. The same happens in other cars when you shift the gear too high. 

When accelerating with the Tipo, you have to rev until the car reaches 3000 - 4000 rpm and then you can shift to second gear with a lesser gap.

My mechanic told me this is absolutely normal. He even said that Fiat designed the engine to rev it up like that.

Why would Fiat design the car like that? I never noticed this in other cars.",3,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/cahrdb/big_gap_between_first_and_second_gear/,1562569377,cahrdb

1100,2008 Fiat 500 check engine light,MlekarDan,"Hi!

I have recently got my first Fiat, wich is 500 1.2 Lounge dualogic with 90 000 km and I have a very weird issue with it:

The car is NL import with complete Fiat service history (last work being done in January 19 - replacementof suspension shock absorbers) but the car has not been run between february and june. But it passed the technical inspection with flying colours wich is not something that happens often with 10 year old car.

So when I got it I noticed that the ride had quite choppy feeling, especially on low revs, like driving 50 km/h on 5th gear, cca 2k rpm's. What I also noticed was that when driving higher speeds (cca 100km/h+) downhill and easing on the accelerator the check engine light wil start flashing until the accelerator is pressed.

So I took it to a service to my guy and he basically told me that the flashing light in fiats from that era means that some error is getting written to OBD. From what he read from his OBD scanner was something in the lines of ""general fuel system error"". So he changed the sparkplugs (they were in quite bad shape) and their electrical wiring and everything seemed fine.

The ride noticeably improved, the engine got way quieter on high revs and my mileage improved but I am still getting the flashing check engine light from time to time at those exact conditions albeit not so often (I'd say once per 100 km). So my mechanic told me to try riding at least two tanks on 100 octane fuel since the issue may be some residue in the injectors.

However, have any of you ever encountered similar error or have you got any idea what else can it mean?

I have also noticed some other things that may be symptoms of the same issue:

* Sometimes the trasmission in auto just ""jumps off the clutch"" when downshifting, but this keeps improving
* Once when softly braking while slowing down to a stop the transmission just put in 1st gear and I had to brake way harder and almost choked the engine until it finally disengaged the clutch/put in neutral
* It seems that the speedometer and rev counter hands are not moving smoothly but with something that seems like tiny pulses. It may be a Fiat thing, never saw anything like that on VW nor Daimler cars I had driven before

So, any insight would be appreciated, my mechanic is a decent one and trust him, however there are not much Fiats driving around my town, so I am asking the community too... Thanks!

I did find a vid of a guy explaining how to put the window back in place after release and it was nothing like my pal explained, but instead he went on and unmounted the whole panel (front cover and protection layer) and went to fit in a red plastic piece that had to be manoeuvred to fit in a specific position. So what am I actually supposed to do in order to just swap the speakers?

It has 103,000 miles on it and it’s been well-maintained with oil changes at the appropriate intervals. Also, I had different interval maintenance performed, but slacked off some after 75,000 miles. I got up to 100,000 miles and planned on doing the hundred thousand mile maintenance. Long story short I went to take it for the hundred thousand mile maintenance today and I was told that the engine oil is low and it’s very murky. It looks like it has metal shavings from the bearings in the engine oil and it looks like the engine is not functioning properly. I didn’t get the specific details beyond The engine looks faulty, the bearings look like they’re breaking down in the engine and making the oil metallic looking, and that my best solution to have a functioning car for a longer period of time would be to replace the Fiat engine. Does that seem reasonable? Is it an engine that could be rebuilt or flushed for less money? I think the retail engine replacement is in the area of $6000 to $7000. With age and mileage on this car it wouldn’t be feasible for me to just replace the engine, I would probably look for a new or different car. Curious what your thoughts are? By the way, the mechanic is a friend of our family and has been extremely honest with myself and many other people we know for many years. I was advised by the mechanic to use the car as a trade-in as soon as possible because of the engine status.

Today after 24 hours of owning the car the transmission went nuts. First, the car wasn’t starting because it was telling me to depress the brakes. I continuously messed with it until I got it started. Once started the “check transmission” light came on. I started driving and the automatic portion wasn’t shifting gear by itself.

I was so house poor it was absurd.

Anyway.  I didn't expect to buy a Fiat 500.  I wanted a hatchback with excellent fuel economy, but that had enough room to move my stuff (mostly clothes and some pictures) across Canada.  

I drove or sat in a Honda Fit, Versa Note, Ford Festiva.  Looked seriously at a Chevy Spark.  Which had a truly gutless engine.  2015 - 84 HP.  The Fiat engine is not much bigger but so much better.  It doesn't speed up quick.  But it can.  

I didn't expect to buy a Fiat.  Though I always loved them when I saw them on the road.  I was first looking at a Wagon.  Subaru Outback or VW Sportwagen.  Those were excessive.

My first Fiat test drive was of a 500L.  A way bogger car.  But a great drive.  It still seemed excessive.

I did have to reassess my belongings some.  Apparently I am minimalist.  I didn't test drive too many cars.  Honestly a 2007 Mazda 3 sedan with 185,000 km for $4900 was the car I did not love looking at, that I test drove right before I bought the much newer Fiat 500.  It had ""everything"".  A great deal.  The 12 year old interior seemed almost new.

It is weird.  I just love the car.  To me it looks like the most beautiful little car ever.  Like it is a corvette or a BMW sports car.  

I haven't even owned it yet.  But I get max fuel economy.  Decent cargo space with the seats down.  And it is fun.  It can do a divided highway fine.  But I avoid them if possible anyway.  I hope it can deal with Canadian winter. But I mostly work from home so I don't need to drive on the worst days.

I am really happy.  I did buy a 6 year old car for near $10k Canadian.  But it has only $44k.  And is unique here.  There aren't many 500's, and seemingly no others for sale in Lounge with a sunroof.  

I hope I remain as happy as I am right now.  It is crazy that the most utilitarian hatchback can feel like a luxury drive to me.  Hope I keep feeling like that!

1191,500e vs 500 long-term cost breakdown,Roygeebeef,"I\`ve been on the fence on whether to pursue a 500 or 500e. Here\`s my family scenario.

Our weekly travel needs for a car is usually 3 times a week, around 50km each day. We dont have kids yet, but plan to have one maybe in 2-3 years after we settle down with our careers.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife likes the 500 but she has no opinion on whether to get the 500 or 500e. Since we do not drive everyday, the gas savings will be minimal for us. That said, are there any blogs or users here that I can refer in order to compare the long term cost breakdown for owning a 500 vs 500e?

&amp;#x200B;

I am leaning towards the 500e because I can avoid the time wasted for routine services (oil &amp; filter changes, engine tune up,etc), the linear power and ""cool"" factor. but say if i keep this car for at minimal 3 years, will I still be substantially paying a lot more overall than a regular 500?

For comparison, the 500e here on the market is selling for about 12-14k, while the 500 sport is selling for about 7-9k

-under 1000 euros, so something from 2003-2007
-under 200k km
-small car
-small petrol engine, so cheap to ensure, but would be nice if it had around 90-100hp
-I want to keep the car for 2-3 years so I'm hoping to find something that doesn't break down frequently.. I'll use it to go around town 2-3 times a week and for a 180km trip every few weekends

So because of these reasons the Fiat Stilo seems quite fitting. Looks nice.. has the 1.4l petrol engine with 95hp. I found a few for sale for 700-900 euro with 125-150k km that look  good. But I'm worried it'll break down frequently

So that's my question for you: any opinions? Is the Stilo reliable enough? Also if you have any other suggestions of cars for me. Thanks!

also, how is it to drive? to be honest, i'm not the best of drivers (i'm improving, don't worry) and need something that's not toooooo terribly crazy. i heard that it's a more feeble version of the Miata so that's good, i guess. i just want something that's easier to drive but i could grow into it as i drive it more.

i'd also be more than happy to learn to work on it as well to offset some of the costs and help to take care of my gorgeous (it's still an understatement) 124 Spider.

is there anything i should know about these cars and taking care of them?",8,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/btqanz/talk_me_out_of_getting_a_124_spider_as_a_first_or/,1558985680,btqanz

So i'm in the works of buying a 74' Fiat and its gonna need some new engine parts (There's an interesting story here) I've taken a look around but haven't stumbled upon any big sites for parts.

Basically, I'm driving over to check out the car. It was about an hour and a half drive. The guy had it in a garage for awhile and was getting it all ready, warming it up etc.

I'm about 2 mins away and I get a call. As he was starting it up, I believe the fuel line broke away and the engine went up in flames. fire department was called to put it out. I went to go see it anyways cause I was already that close to the house just to take a look. Pretty much everything that was rubber was gone, but the body and everything else still seemed ok. I'm now just waiting to hear back from the seller once he gets insurance sorted and if the car is still going to be repairable.

1261,The good/bad/ugly from 500x owners - help!,narnia104,"Hey everyone,

I’m in the market for a new car. I’m looking at a few different makes, but keep coming back to the Fiat 500x. But I have a lot of uncertainties regarding reliability, and maintenance costs. 

Some background info - 
The last car I owned was a Mini Cooper. I was SO adamant about buying a Mini. Thankfully, my mini never left me stranded on the side of the road. But ANY maintenance, even an oil change, cost me so much money. I knew the maintenance cost was below average, but I put so much money into that car. She was probably in the shop once every couple months. When I had an opportunity to sell her privately, I jumped on it. 

Now that I’m shopping for a new car, it’s adamant that I get a more reliable, cheaper to maintain car. So far I’ve test driven a Buick Encore, Kia Soul, and a Fiat 500x. 

My head says, “get the Kia Soul.” It’s practical, and known to stand the test of time. I’m looking to buy a car to drive til it won’t drive anymore. Hopefully get to at least 100k with no major issues. 

But my heart says, “GET THE FIAT.” Aesthetically it reminds me a lot of my Mini. And added convenience features make it appealing - push start, safety features like blind spot monitoring, etc. 

I’ve watched just about every YouTube video on the Fiat 500x, and have tried to do as much research as possible on the reliability and maintenance. From what I gather, I see a lot of mixed reviews.  Seems to be pretty biased on both sides. There’s either people fretting about the brand’s reliability from decades ago and how it translates to today, or die hard fans of the brand that would most likely own a Fiat regardless of practicality. Again, very similar to what I found with my Mini research. 

So, my question is for anyone that owns or is very familiar with the Fiat brand - aesthetics aside, how practical is the Fiat 500x? What is your personal experience in repairs, maintenance costs, etc. Please tell me the good, bad AND ugly! I want to be sure whatever I choose, I’ll be educated in my decision.

Started with a whirring coming from the transmission (throw out bearing dying) and ended with a completely nonfunctional clutch. The cause, at this point, I believe to be a blown input shaft seal, which sprayed the clutch assembly with trans fluid and completely drained the transmission of fluid. Now I must replace the clutch assembly and throw out bearing at a minimum, but I am sure there will be more as I do not yet know the cause of the blown seal.

Financially, this will be really difficult for me, I can barely afford the parts, and I absolutely cannot afford to take it to the dealer, I will have to do this 14 hour job myself. Warranty is out of the question. I guess i'm just looking for advice on the best way to go about doing this, and if there are any options I have to save money. I have already purchased the throw out bearing and proper trans fluid. I will also need the technical walkthroughs if anyone has any, if not, I will purchase them.

I haven't had any issues besides a spark plug replacement and routine maintenance. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I notice a squealing noise when the clutch is disengaged, take it into the shop and after sitting with it for a week they tell me that I need a new throw out bearing and flywheel, not covered under warranty due to wear and tear with a quote of $2500.

Has anyone else had similar issues after getting the recall work done? I can't help but wonder if the recall issue may have caused undue stress on the bearing prior to the fix.",1,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/bdmiiu/2015_500_pop_manual_needs_new_flywheel_and_throw/,1555368998,bdmiiu

1327,Fiat Marea HLX [2.0 20V engine issues],ElegantSerr,"Hello Fiat redditors

About 6 months ago I've bought a 1997 Fiat Marea HLX with the 2.0L 20V engine, if I'm right it's like the Coupé engine without a turbo. I like the looks of the Marea and it's a very comfortable car for some cruising. I've been keeping it maintained and daily driving it for the past 6 months.

Last Saturday the engine suddenly stopped. I slowly warmed it up, did some easy driving on the way to fill up on petrol, took her out for a fun drive in Germany on the highway. Did about 180\~200km/h without any issues on the way in, took the off-ramp to turn back.

I rolled her out easy but the ***engine started sputtering and jumping down and up in revs*** when I was on the way to the on-ramp back but it didn't stop working yet.

Back on the highway I slowly turned up the speed to 120km/h, no problems, after a bit I thought to turn it back up to 180km/h but it never got there. At around 160km/h the engine's RPMs dropped to 0, dash lights came on. I hit the clutch and put it in neutral and kept rolling until I got to a roadside parking area. ***The starter couldn't turn the crankshaft***, I believe I burned the starter while trying, so I originally thought my engine was dead. I got towed back home.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to yesterday.

The car has been towed to the garage, they did a few quick diagnostics and managed to rotate the crankshaft by force, after this it started! Engine idles but doesn't like to deliver power. The mechanics believe it may be the crankshaft and/or bearings.

&amp;#x200B;

What a weird trip it's been. Next week Wednesday will be a diagnostic of the engine with a pending revision but I fear the worst.",0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/bbmluo/fiat_marea_hlx_20_20v_engine_issues/,1554906140,bbmluo

All traffic information will be sent to you in real time (roads resected, traffic jam areas, radar zones, road works ...), so the Fiat car radio will offer you the best routes to take.

If you want to go to more chic places, the device will offer all the best points of interest. Regarding the updates of Waze, do not worry, because you will have 5 years of free updates.

With the dual zone option, it will be possible for you to run two applications at a time. You will be able to browse and surf the Net at the same time.

The car radios of this brand are perfect rivals for the Mini Cooper GPS unit. The options are varied and you can be safe and comfortable.

# Make your calls safe

First of all, you have to know that it is necessary to connect the Fiat car stereo to your smartphone using Bluetooth. After, all your contacts will be coordinated automatically on the car radio screen, as well as missed calls, calls made.

The steering wheel controls will make it easier for you to answer and make calls. Thus, it would be more necessary to touch the car radio Fiat or your smartphone.

&amp;#x200B;

# Internet available everywhere

It is possible to connect on the Net everywhere with the car radio Fiat. You only need a WiFi connection or a 4G / 3G key. It will then be possible to consult all your favorite sites or download the best applications or other files (audio, video, work files ...)

Short of getting one of those cheaters, is there a setting or something that can be done to disable just the passenger seatbelt alert?  My other car is a Subaru, and to get that done there, you need to just lock and unlock the seatbelt 15 times within 30 seconds, so I was hoping there was some magic combo like that.
3. The only badging on the car that says Fiat is on the steering wheel.. can someone point me towards a (quality) replacement badge for that?
4. I've seen a few opinions here, but was wondering if it was safe to use my power washer (on low pressure) to clean the car?  It seems like even brushless car washes are out, so I'm trying to find a way to avoid having to do it all by hand.

1398,Tipo: mp3 radio / display console exchangeable with Android Auto display (same connections?),NoUserLeftException,"I'm planning to order a new Fiat Tipo 2019.  
I'd like the POP variant since I don't need the most technical stuff. But what I really want is Android Auto.  
It seems that Android Auto is only available in the ""Mirror"" variant, whereby this is only an upgrade to the ""Street"" variant. That means 

POP has only an ""mp3 radio radio with USB""

STREET (upgrade to POP) has only a 3'' radio with Bluetooth

MIRROR (upgrade to STREET) has the 7'' Touchscreen HD with Android Auto.

With the POP TECH UPGRADE, you only get the 3'' radio with bluetooth.

(In 2019, Fiat obviously changed their variants. In 2018 there was an EASY variant which has supposedly Android Auto. At least they advertise it with this model on the second-hand car market.)  


My question is if anybody knows if there is any reason why it should not be possible to just exchange the default mp3 radio with the Android Auto console? (I'd like to have an argument if the salesman want to tell me stories).  


It seems that it is even possible with older ""incompatible"" Fiat models, see here: [https://www.joyingauto.com/blog/tag/fiat-car-radio-fiat-android-auto-android-car-fiat-500-car-radio-for-fiat-punto-stereo-fiat-bravo-and/](https://www.joyingauto.com/blog/tag/fiat-car-radio-fiat-android-auto-android-car-fiat-500-car-radio-for-fiat-punto-stereo-fiat-bravo-and/)  


In my opinion there should be no argument why this is not possible with different variants of the same model.

I did some research and saw people mention it could be the condenser hose from the AC. Could this be the culprit even though I don't run the AC much? I do run the vent a lot, usually on the defrost setting.

1401,Burning(?) smell when going uphill in an automatic 2015 Fiat 500,oceanrainfairy,"I'm really bad at identifying smells, so I don't know for sure that it's a burning smell...but it's definitely a smell. BUT...only sometimes. I've got a big hill that I go up during my commute every day, and *sometimes* when I'm going up it I smell the smell. As soon as I get to the top and level off the smell goes away. I've never smelled it in any other situation. I -think- that it's happening when it doesn't shift right when I start to go up the hill (I've only ever had automatics so I don't know much about cars shifting...), though it doesn't go away until the top even after it shifts. From what I understand not shifting into the right gear doesn't cause a smell, but that's the only thing I've noticed that is maybe different from other times when it doesn't have the smell - though I couldn't swear that it always has the smell when it doesn't shift right away on the hill.

None of the common causes of burning smells I've read on the internet could be it: it's only when going uphill, so it's not the brakes; it's an automatic, so I'm not burning the clutch; and I don't smell it when I get home and get out of the car, which supposedly is when you'll smell burning oil the most (plus I would imagine that would be every day? I don't think it happens even as often as once a week). Does anyone have any thoughts on what else it could be, what I could look for that might be another symptom of something?

I´m thinking of getting my very first car. Mostly for driving places in the weekend if I feel like it. I won´t use it every day,  but I´m sure that will happen some time in the future. Who knows?

ANYWAYS. I want to get your honest opinion about the car.

The model is: Fiat Grande Punto 1,4 - 95HP 2006, 137 800 km. It´s red and looks pretty badass I must say. It has some cool extra features like: Sunroof, backing sensors, park sensors etc.

The seller (private, not from a store) says there are no known problems with it and that it runs smooth.

I have a few questions:

\- I live in Norway so the weather is both warm and cold. How does a car like this handle the winter? I have no garage, so it will be parked outside.

\- The car is imported. Does that change anything?- The price is around 3000€ - everything is expensive in this country. Should I try to lower it?

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on your answers I might take a look at it and maybe buy it next weekend, so I really appreciate your comments - both positive and negative. Any experience you have with the car, please share it!

Thanks.

Check my previous posts to see the build: [u/mannydantyla](https://www.reddit.com/u/mannydantyla)

So I found these: [http://www.stockwheels.com/Fiat-500-2012-2018-16x6-5-Aluminum-Alloy-Chrome-5-Split-Spoke-61663-Wheel-Rim](http://www.stockwheels.com/Fiat-500-2012-2018-16x6-5-Aluminum-Alloy-Chrome-5-Split-Spoke-61663-Wheel-Rim)

And when I read that they where +63.5mm I was ecstatic! Only other wheel I could find (in my budget) with an offset even close to that had an offset of +48mm (MINI cooper rims).

But, it started to sound too good to be true. All other Fiat 500 rims are +35mm, and when I search online for those rims from other sells, [some say the offset is +41mm](https://www.detroitwheelandtire.com/hol-61663-pgp-a.html) and [others say](https://www.wheelership.com/brand-new-16-x-6-5-fiat-500-2012-2013-2014-2015-2016-2017-factory-oem-wheel-machined-w-charcoal-rim-61663.html?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;adpos=1o1&amp;scid=scplp2558&amp;sc_intid=2558&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAh9njBRCYARIsALJhQkEOLfWbLo2p2EcH31jdF4pFoeZtCZ6Xglgz-6B87hcqq2MDuRzYzb8aAhNPEALw_wcB) the offset is +35mm.

1464,Driving Test: Manual Shifting,lemmvs,"This isn't really a problem with FIAT or any specific company, apparently it is an occurrence that many dealerships do.

When I bought my manual 6 speed FIAT 500 I took it for a test drive and it shifted beautifully. I can't express how smooth it felt to shift into other gears. However, about 5 hours later when it was finished being detailed and I got in it for the first time as an owner, it felt 'rougher'. It was no where near shifting as smoothly and you felt a physical friction when moving the stick.   


Please keep in mind I have been driving Manual Transmissions for over a decade and I know how to shift correctly. My only question is, did the dealership remove some part of my automobile? Do they purposefully degrade the experience in any way? Do they put a premium shifting arrangement just for show and then remove it when you actually purchase?",6,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/an50ky/driving_test_manual_shifting/,1549307107,an50ky
1465,“Engine Heater” warning accompanied by burning plastic smell?,its_liiiiit_fam,"2013 500 Sport owner checking in from Alberta, Canada where it’s supposed to be -45 tonight lol. 

I went outside to hook my car up to the block heater and start it for about 15 mins, since I haven’t driven it all weekend. It started very atrociously (almost didn’t start at all), but I got it running and went to stand in the garage to make sure I didn’t leave the running car unsupervised.

As I was standing there, I started to smell a really strong smell, at first I thought it was just someone smoking weed, or perhaps a skunk, but then it dawned on me it’s coming from my car. I know what burning oil smells like and it wasn’t that - it almost smelled like burning rubber or plastic to me. About 5 minutes into running the car it got very strong but went away very quickly.

Then, when I went to shut it off, I noticed a funny warning on the display. Keep in mind, the display was so frozen that this message was overlapped on top of “left front door open” because the lights were too slow to shut off in time. I made it out to be something about “engine heater”, which I have never seen before. 

I googled it and saw it was likely “engine heater recommended”, which displays when it gets very cold and you shut your car off. If that’s it then it’s no big deal; I have it plugged in to our block heater and it’s timed to turn on at 10 pm. 

However I am concerned given that burning smell, and am wondering if maybe it was something else, but since the display was frozen I wouldn’t know what it was trying to say. 

TL;DR - got an engine warning after shutting my frozen car off and would like to confirm if it was just the engine heater recommended message; also am wondering what that burning plastic smell was and if I should be concerned or just dismiss it because it’s 40 below and shit happens when it gets this cold lol

Many times if I wait, it'll get louder, then softer, then louder, then softer, and eventually will stop.

But I've read that unfortunately Fiat is not doing so well here in North America, with less than 20 500Ls sold in 2018. Is this something to be worried about? How is the reliability of the 500L? Should I look for specific things when testing one? I hope that it's a good idea to buy a 500L, I'd rather have the 500, but the L is a nice compromise =)

1504,Fiat Panda 4x4 - 1987,dharmabum28,"Hello,

I am an American in Europe and considering buying a 4x4 Panda, around 1987-88 year. I am interested in this car because I see them for low prices, they have simple mechanical structure, and a 4x4 is great for me to get through snow and some bumpy dirt roads.

I found one where I am staying in Italy for ~2000 euros, a 1988 I believe, good condition in the engine, body not perfect but no major damage, and uses CNG (methane) gas. The owner says 60,000km on it. Seems like a good deal.

Is CNG fuel difficult to find? I am familiar with it in Tbilisi, Georgia area, where many cars are using it so it's easy to fill, but I wonder if road trips across the EU are complicated by this. I am probably going to register the car in Hungary where I have temporary residence, which I hope will be better for insurance and licensing costs, too, and wonder if anybody has insight on that.

Overall, I've driven a lot of rental Fiats, but am curious about the advice on owning an older one and what to expect on difficulty and cost for maintenance!",10,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/aekz2k/fiat_panda_4x4_1987/,1547139832,aekz2k

1573,Electrical issue? 2013 USA Fiat 500 Abarth - front doors speakers &amp; tweeters cutting and out.,hjungj21o,"Hi everyone,

I picked up a 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth (my first manual tranny car!) two weeks ago.The previous owner had installed a new entertainment unit (Pioneer AVH-4200NEX) in lieu of the stock radio unit, as well as a subwoofer in the trunk.Everything was in great working condition during inspection of the car, and I hadn't felt the need to turn on any music until last night while I was doing some late night cruising on the highway... That's when I realized the driver's side speaker and tweeter would cut in and out. Not sure what triggers the sound coming back in. Upon closer inspection, I found that when the driver's side speakers do come in, the passenger side speakers seem to go out so they are alternating cutting in and out (although the passenger side speakers seem to hold onto the sound a little more). My guess is bad wiring during installation of the subwoofer and head unit + the wet, cold conditions of the Northeast US.

The subwoofer is directly behind the driver's side back seat, if that helps. Not the end of the world because I'd rather listen to the exhaust notes when putting around town but it would still bother me during longer drives that I'd have to make from time to time. If you guys had any similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it and what you did to fix the issue before I start contacting dealers/shops around me for a proper diagnosis/quotes for repair. 

Oh, and for a more serious issue - when I do stall the car (still getting used to the car) and turn back on, the airbag check light comes on for 15 seconds, and then goes away. It does not throw that error when I start the car normally, not quickly after stalling. Is this anything serious that I should look into?

My old car was almost paid off and I don’t want a car payment so I plan to take what I get for the total loss and just buy a car cash. I’ve been seeing 2012-2104 500 pops with less than 50k miles for under $7,000. This is right in my wheelhouse in terms of budget and I’ve always loved the look of the 500. 

That said, I don’t want to buy a car just because it looks nice. I actually love smaller cars (my rental right now is an Impala and it’s just way too big for me) and I used to want a mini but the cost of ownership turned me off. The 500 has that same look and is just all around more affordable. In fact every time I see one, I think, “man that’s a cool little car.”

Maybe I’m asking into an echo chamber, but what thoughts do you guys have? Any big issues I’d want to look for when shopping? Any reasons you might recommend against or cautions? 

I browsed the sub and it seems like lots of people put a ton of miles on these things with not much crazy maintenance. I like having a car that I can drive up to 150,000 miles or so before I get a new one. I planned to keep my old car for another 5 years or so, but being a crappy Kia, who knows if it would’ve made it. 

Anyway, any thoughts from you folks would be great. I’m eyeing a blue 2014 pop with like 45,000 miles for about $6,500. Carfax report shows one owner, no mechanical issues, etc. I’m a little in love with it but I thought, “why not ask reddit for some advice first?”

1621,Broken Turbo Help,slusholyshit,"I picked up a 2012 Fiat 500 Abarth earlier this year, clean title and only 40,000 miles, and recently it's been acting up so I took it to my local Fiat dealership to have them check it out. Long story short they informed me I need to completely replace the turbo in it, which they'll charge me $2500 (before tax) for. I'm a 20 year-old college student and can not afford that at all right now, but might be able to later this year. My question is basically how long could I get away with not replacing turbo? Will it ruin other parts of the car if I put it off a couple months? Will continuing to drive it ruin other parts of the car as well? The dealership told me it could range anywhere from weeks to months but didn't describe exactly what that means when it's life runs out, so I have no idea if I should just not touch it at all until I fix the turbo or if I'm good to drive it a little longer. In general it just feels like it's lost power, and my commute is only 20 minutes so I don't think I'd be stressing it too much. Any advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Symptoms: A week and a half ago I was driving between states and going 90 MPH (not in sport mode if that makes a difference) when suddenly my car slightly jolted and felt like it was losing power. My car slowed down to 70 MPH and wouldn't go any faster than that, even with the pedal down all the way. After that, driving to and from work going 80 MPH 2-3 times over the course of a week the same thing happened. The diagnosis from Fiat was ""your turbo is overcharging 5 pounds,"" or something along those lines. Will be getting more information tomorrow 11/7 when I pick up the car.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR How long can I go with a busted turbo before needing to replace it, and how much damage will not replacing it right away do to the rest of the car?

1622,Replacing broken radio in Punto EVO,Babu_the_Ocelot,"Hey gang, 

The radio in my 2011 Punto EVO is dead and while I've been researching how to replace it, I've encountered a few questions that I can't seem to find the answer on from a google search, so here I am, hoping you guys can help! 

So my understanding is that if you go down the ebay second hand route, it's not a simple case of pulling the old one out and putting the new one in, because the new one will need coded. This brings me to question 1) Can I use the code from the old radio in the new radio? I.e. if I could find the old radio code, can I type that into the new radio to unlock it? I would think that you can because people often have to re-type their code in to their radios if the car battery gets disconnected for repairs. 

Assuming then that you CAN use the pre-existing code for the new radio, does anyone know how I can find this pre-existing code? Can I find it stamped somewhere in my car (and if so, where in the EVO Puntos is it?) or will I have to phone someone up with my VIN or some other number to retrieve it?

If it could just have one issue at a time... then I might have a shot at accurately troubleshooting... 

...but there's enough all at once to indicate a loose ground or something, yet I already tried all the crap under the battery tray... 

Already rewired the damn hatch... with silicone wire, all the hatch stuff works fine now...

Then the damn left window regulator decides to break... 

And now... here we are with the ""I can't stay without damn CEL's long enough for the Emissions Monitors to enter a ready state so I can pass the damn thing and get my tags so I can drive as much as I want to troubleshoot various potential solutions...""

Other than under the battery tray, and the disaster at the hatch... where else are there grounds... (or whatever the hell else...) that bumps in the road + turning sharp would see it cause the misfire and Hill start /  ""All the things are broke"" issues? Which then just goes away after a few seconds of stomping on it with my right foot...

It also seems to be heat related... because it doesn't usually happen until about 25 miles into a trip...

I have the coils, and can swap those out, but it's obviously more than that... just a misfire should not make all that other ESC / Hillstart Assist / ABS crap light up without some other damn electrical issue as the real cause right?

1641,A word of advice.,tgarrettallen,"Sorry this isn’t Fiat exclusive advice but it greatly benefits Fiat 500 owners. 

A couple nights ago a drunk driver crashed through my yard and side swiped the rear of my car damaging the tail lights hatch and bumper. Honestly it wasn’t a ton of damage but ended up being around 3000 dollars worth of repairs. 

The car was a 2013 Fiat POP with rims and sport spoiler. 48k miles. Clean all around. 

The amount of damage done was enough to total the car. Now here comes the advice. If your insurance company offers it,  new car assistance or gap insurance will save you so much trouble. The Fiats don’t hold their value and this is one way to make sure you get what you need to buy a new car. 

I was offered 8k vs the 5k for the value of the car. So I’m able to get a newer model with lower mileage and warranty. All of the other cars in the range of what I was getting back were either older or had substantially higher miles. 

TLDR: if you own a fiat 500, they don’t hold their value as much and getting gap insurance will benefit you greatly. ",8,8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/9taqbp/a_word_of_advice/,1541088132,9taqbp

The electronic throttle control, automatic gearbox fault, esc light and check engine light. Idling at the pump and I feel like the engine is going to shake itself out of the car. I turn it off and restart, but the same thing. 

I decide to drive home. It's a Sunday night and I don't have many options. Thankfully the roads are relatively clear at that time of night and it's only a 2.5 mile trip. 

It drives horrible. It doesn't feel like I'm giving it any gas and is slow to get going. Braking and coming to a stop feels like my car is going to shake itself apart.

The service records were shared with me and the turbocharger was changed 10 months ago. There were also convertible straps that got changed.

I plan to drive it for a couple of years only, not for daily commute just a pleasure ride. Falls within my budget of $12k so I am ready to proceed in purchasing it but i want to make this is not a rip off.

One is on/in the hatch and seems to be caused by exhaust vibrations, the other is somewhere on the passenger side and really only makes a noise when I hit a bump. 

For the first one, I've looked at the top taillight assembly, factory amp cover, and other panels in the area but can't seem to track it down. My next step is to take the inside cover off, make sure the rear window is tightened down to spec (it has a bit of play in it), and then dynamat the whole hatch. No kill like overkill, right?

Back in July, my battery died and I changed it out.  Coincidentally, my registration/inspection was due by the end of the month so two weeks after this occurred, I took it in to get inspected and they told me that it failed because of the above tests weren't completed yet.   I had this problem before on my other cars (Volkswagen Jetta, Honda Odyssey, Honday Accord) but all three have reset within 100 miles of the change.    


My wife usually uses this car for short-distance commuting, so, while we had already done about 300 miles since the battery change,  I thought maybe we just didn't take it up to highway speed/enough revs for long enough to get it to pass the test.   I went on a few drives at highway speed and took it in the following week with the same results.    I looked online for a procedure to get the tests to cycle through (eg. start on a cold engine, drive 5 minutes at 30-35 mph then take it up to 50-55 for 5 minutes and another procedure that was a little more detailed.  I've done this several times.  Because of our schedules, I didn't get to take it back in until two weeks ago, and still the car hasn't gone through the test.     


I'm at a loss at what else I can do.   I went ahead and bought a more modern ODBII reader that will do the smog readiness tests and after going through these cycles two more times over this weekend with the same results -- at this point we've put in over 3,000 miles since the battery change.  Is there anything else I can try before I take it back to the dealership and spend way too much money to get this fixed just so that it can pass the inspection?",1,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/9ie4lp/2013_fiat_pop_smog_test_readiness_failures/,1537754892,9ie4lp

1730,"500e owners, can you tell me about your experience?",smartlypretty,"Second post- hi!

I just got a Fiat 500e from Carvana, and so far I really, really like it. I didn't know what I was looking for, or that this car existed. It's a great car thusfar. 

It seems like there's a little bit of a learning curve so I thought maybe 500e owners here could tell me about their experiences.

Did you install a charging station? Level 1 or 2? I was going to try to get a 2 but I can always charge overnight. Is there a benefit to a lvl 1?

Has anyone here swapped out their radio for a touchscreen? Added an aftermarket backup camera?

What's it like in 6 months+, do you still love the car?

Thanks!

1735,Are 500 Abarths engines underrated?,Dirtyscab,"The US 500 Abarths are rated at 160 horsepower. I've heard some people suggest they are underrated from the factory. In a car and driver article comparing the abarth, fiesta st, and mini Cooper s, the Abarth is neck and neck with the others in 0-60 despite supposedly being 30-40 horsepower lower. It is about 200 lbs lighter, but I'd imagine 40 horsepower and some extra low down torque on the others would give them more than a 0.20 second lead. 

EDIT: To add to the list, the Veloster turbo is rated around the same weight as the ST and cooper, with 200 horsepower, and floats around 7 second 0-60 as well.

Does anyone have some evidence for this beyond some internet hearsay? I'm particularly interested because I got a tune for my Abarth that is supposed to bump it up to 200 horsepower, and it doesn't really feel any quicker. 160-200 should be a very noticeable difference, but I'm thinking if the stock is actually like 180-ish horsepower that would make the power bump less noticeable.

I would like to buy the brakes and tires on my own and have my local mechanic install the brakes and tires because I assume this will be cheaper than having the dealership handle everything.

I live in South Philadelphia and bought the car because it's easy to park. I would like tires that can handle a few inches of snow as we tend to get 1 or 2 major snowfalls a year in Philly. Any recommendations or advice would be most appreciated.

1751,Need some help differentiating between Fiat 500 2018 Model types,ManSore,"Hey Fiat feople,

&amp;#x200B;

Im looking to get myself a new Fiat 500 2018 but am undecided between a Pop and Abarth. I understand that in the 2018 models, the Pop and Lounge both have turbo now but not at powerful as the Abarth. Would someone be willing to explain the other minute differences in the three models? I dont want to go into the dealer without having an idea and being sold something I dont need. I dont require fancy trimmings or seatings. I dont want a sunroof as I heard that really takes away from headroom. I dont know what the difference between a hatchback and cabrio is. From what I do know, I would think to only decide between a Pop and Abarth unless if the Lounge has something really unique that I mustve missed while comparing the specs on the site.  


&amp;#x200B;

I live in NYC and am looking to alleviate parking pains with the Fiat 500. I want to get an Abarth but is it really worth it to get an Abarth (additional $100/mo on lease according to website) now over a Pop or Lounge that have a turbo for typical use? Is the Turbo in the Pop and Lounge sufficient to not make the car feel sluggish in those times of merging needs. I dont intend to do crazy speeds. Maximum 70MPH if thats the current traffic flow on the freeway. I probably will only be the only one in the car most of the time aside from the occasional girlfriend and even more rare family. Id have 4 seats full maybe a handful of times a year. I want to get automatic transmission for those long rides out of state and to make things easier for my girlfriend if she decides to drive it now and then. Usual commute is a little less than  25miles/day with a mix of highways and local streets (terrible conditions). Im not a speed demon but at the same time i dont want to ever feel buyers remorse in getting the lesser slower model although Ive read here that the older 2013(?) turbo models had the same power as current 2018 Pop/Lounge. I currently (share) drive a 2016 Honda FIT and want to get a car for my OWN. Any input is appreciate!

1759,"New Yorker considering a Carvana 15 or 16 500e, advice?",smartlypretty,"Hi! I've never owned a Fiat but I have owned two Beetles, when my kids were in carseats.

It seems like used 500e models are available to New Yorkers through some dealers, but I saw it on Carvana. After an unpleasant dealer experience trying to lease a new 500x, I was attracted to the 500e. I LOVE the white interior on the orange, but tiffany blue is my favorite color and that car is also well-styled.

Having never owned a Fiat or an EV, I'm just wondering if there are considerations I'm not ... considering. These are u/smartlypretty specs:

* I work at home and get my groceries delivered;
* When I travel, which is rare, I tend to rent a larger SUV;
* I have two teenagers who rarely both accompany me anywhere;
* The furthest I ever have to go on occasion is the airport, which is 23 miles away;
* We can install a charger;
* There are free charging stations in my town;
* I am at the end of my current lease from 2014 and put about 21K miles on the car.

Does this all make this a clever choice for me or a dumb one? I think I can get a Carvana warranty on top of the remaining warranty, which I think off the top of my head is 8 years for the battery.

Is it better to pay more for a certain year or fewer miles? Anything else I'm not considering?

1787,2012 Fiat 500 Lounge (Electrical issue?),ThisGuy32,"Hello All!

So to start I've had this Fiat since day 1. I is approximately 6-7 years old with 111k miles on it. 

This is my issue:

First when the lights are off - it states for me to check my daytime running lights (one is out).

If I leave my lights On - I get no warnings and the lights are on.

Now onto the main issue - when the lights are now on - (not the daytime running lights - the regular lights) after a little bit of driving (i'd say approximately 15-20 minutes) my battery light shows up, a red bolt blinks and the car putters then dies.. 

Is there a short somewhere? Maybe my alternator is going?

1788,Used 500e with very (too?) few miles,rbbbt,"I'm looking at getting a used 500e - saw a 2015 with 6500 miles.  


I'm wondering if that low mileage is something to worry about, particularly regarding the battery. It could be the owner was making short trips twice a week, or it could be that they drove it for a couple months and then left it sitting for two years. I'm guessing that would be terrible for the battery, and might even void the battery warranty?

&amp;#x200B;

Side question (should maybe make its own post): I'm in Oklahoma. New 500e's don't sell here, but can I rely on a Fiat dealership to service one anyway?

1791,2016 500X - trouble starting car,LeiaOrigami,"Hi everyone. I’m hoping to find some help in troubleshooting why my Fiat won’t start. I haven’t had any issues before this happened. I bought it used in May and it’s been working fine the whole time.

Yesterday I went to turn on my car and the screen said that my key fob wasn’t detected. I figured the battery was dead so I tried turning on the car like the manual said, by pushing the button with the side of the key fob. The dashboard lights, a/c, etc. all came on, however the engine didn’t start at all and I didn’t hear or feel anything indicating the car was trying to start or something. Once this happened a bunch of error messages came up saying I needed to service my brakes, power steering, airbags, etc etc. I thought maybe the battery was dead so I jumped it- still the same issues. The key fob does work to lock and unlock the car, but it won’t remote start. Also, whenever I lock the car, the horn doesn’t fully sound; it’s like a muffled type of sound, which I’ve never heard before. Not sure if that means anything (I’m not well-educated on car maintenance and repair).

If any of you have some insight into what may be the problem, I would greatly appreciate advice! Thanks!

I bought a 2015 Fiat 500 (it's an automatic) a few months ago, and just moved to an area where I have a long, substantial hill I have to go up during my commute home. The engine is quite a bit louder when I'm going up than when I'm driving flat - it's not whining or anything, just loud and sounds like it's working harder. Is that ok? Is it likely that since I've been able to get up it, it shouldn't be a problem, or is it likely that it's a strain on the engine and it might not be able to make it some day?

1815,500e warranty obligations,elmarkitse,"Can someone help clarify a dealers obligation to service a 500e in a market without a certified tech? The closest Fiat dealer with one is the next state over (Midwest, not in CA or OR where they are more common), but we have a few dealerships in town who don’t have techs certified on the car on staff.

After speaking with both dealerships, I’ve been told ‘that’s really expensive, and we haven’t sent someone out to get that’ yet. To do service on our car would involve bringing someone in and also bringing in gear. Neither place wants to deal with it and shuts down the conversation very quickly. No ‘21’ point inspection, no warranty work, nothing, just a vaguely more polite version of ‘take a long drive off a short charge’

I am sympathetic to their circumstances and recognize they aren’t well suited to the task. There aren’t many 500e’s here, the ROI is marginal, and bringing someone in is a p.i.t.a. At the same time, driving the car would involve 15 to 18 hours (each way) factoring I’m charging and towing it is also a hassle and at least a day assuming the work can be done in a day.

Are the dealerships required by Fiat to service the 500e’s that find their way into the market? At what level? If I have a warranty repair can they just say ‘nah, we aren’t interested, go somewhere else’? Similarly can they make discovering a warranty issue a moot point by treating something smaller, like an inspection, the same way?

My girlfriend recently bought a fiat 500, and has been noticing some rough shifts from about 0-30 mph.

I just took it for a drive and was able to replicate the phenomenon a bit.  From what the google has told me, it seems like the 500 is kind of known for not having the best transmission?  That's kind of how it felt to me as well - my hypothesis is that it's a combination of the not best transmission + she has just gone from driving a giant mercury sedan to the very light 500, so the shift to a lighter vehicle is probably a factor as well.

Anyway, I'm not a car guy so I figured I'd see if anyone here has had similar experiences.  It's still under warranty so worst case we can just take it in to the dealer.

1842,"USB stick and .mp3 files, Fiat 500",badabing1999," Hey,  


I have a 16GB FAT32 formatted USB stick that I use to listen to music in my car. It's a Fiat 500 Abarth.  


I added some music (27 songs) last week and everything went smoothly, the car player read everything perfectly. However, yesterday, I added 8 other songs and only one is being recognized by my car player. So, instead of displaying 35 songs as it does on my laptop, the car is displaying 28 of them. I don't understand. I thought maybe that the bitrate of those last 7 songs was too high for the car player but it doesn't add up since the one song that the car plays has a 128 bitrate, just like some of the songs that the player doesn't read.  


Any ideas? Thanks ",2,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/9557vh/usb_stick_and_mp3_files_fiat_500/,1533589679,9557vh

1928,2013 Fiat 500 Climate Controls,VisibleTank,The climate control lights in my 2013 fiat 500 burnt out and I watched a video on how to replace them. In the process of removing the manual climate control cover. 2 of the 6 metal clips that hold the panel onto the climate control fell deep into the center console kinda of shifter. I replaced the bulbs and made sure that they worked before I put the switch panel back on. When I did I turned all of the switches to see if they still functioned and thats when it happened. The vent selector switch operated once and I heard a plastic piece fall into the abyss. Are there any ways to get the plastic piece back from the depths of my 500? And fix the climate controls on my car. I have searched the web and haven't found any tutorials that will help me. Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

I’m a long time Volkswagen guy (LOTS of water cooled VWs, current daily driver is a MK2 Jetta w/ VR6 swap) so I’m more than accustomed to &lt;ahem&gt; quirky cars with rattles and oddball issues. From what I gather though the 500e drivetrain is essentially all Bosch, which sounds terrific. Just wondering if I should expect the rest of the car to have common issues. This would be my backup / commuter car for when I need to repair my Volkswagen or need to save on fuel.

Work commute is about 14 miles each direction, mostly freeway though it’s not uncommon for traffic to slow to stop &amp; go at times. Our office already has a Leaf charging outside most days so (at least) level 1 charging is available. Live in Kentucky where A/C and heat will definitely be used during the respective seasons.

Do these sound right? I think the two that scare me the most are the oil issue and the rattling ... I can’t stand that more than anything else in a car for some reason.

1989,2014 500L automatic no longer manually shifting,Caindris,"Hey everyone!

So to give a bit of background my 2014 Fiat 500L autoshifter stopped working due to the magnet clip somehow snapping. It took a while for me to understand how the piece works but it's basically a magnet on a clip that goes up/down when you ""manually"" shift (it fits on the left side of the shifter, btw). I was able to recover part of the broken clip and 3D print the missing half but I'm weary of the strength since it's not mold injected. I tried talking to the dealership and they were clueless on the part and wanted to replace the entire transmission. Does anyone know how I can get this part?  Or if I'm even on the right track?

2021,"Decision-wise, how much weight do you put in a manual?",ChulaK,"So I've been looking around for my first car (and my dream car at that), and I've been torn between ND Miata or the 124 Spider. I've been more towards the Miata because of the many options already available in the used market with GT/Club trims already being listed at sub-$20k USD.

The *right* 124 Spider is just harder to find, especially that it has a lot more variations. The more options it has, the more rare it is to find especially here in the US. I actually found one with my dream configuration: Abarth, LED lights (hard to find *with* Abarth trim), white with heritage stripe (which is even *more* rare to find here in US), *zomg red leather seats!!*... automatic. Sure it doesn't have the red front lip or mirror caps like the Euro spec'd Abarths but this comes pretty damn close. Those are easy fixes anyway.

It is a deal breaker? I'm a patient man and I can wait. If a car had your dream configuration but was an automatic, would you turn away?

I'm really struggling with this one and I really don't want to succumb to the automatic. The main reason for choosing the 124 Spider over the Miata was that reviews say it's a better ride, more sound deadening. I live out in the suburbs where it's mostly residential and highways and felt like I would just be torturing myself in the long run if I had the Miata mostly out in the highways vs the 124 Spider which is more of a truer GT cruiser. I'm also out in the Northeast so the top will be up for a good portion of the year.

I had this creeping thought in my head that *maybeeee* the automatic wouldn't be too bad? I was watching reviews of the automatic still being able to do burnouts.

2070,Sensible Mods For A 2015 Abarth,abel1389,"I posted this over at r/Abarth as well, but figured I might get a wider response here.

So I’ve recently bought a used 2015 Abarth (auto), damn near new, and I’m not expecting issues right off the bat. I’ve read quite a few people say they tend to fall apart a little easy, but that most of the typical issues can usually be either fixed or outright avoided with some aftermarket work. Since it’s been a goal of mine to learn the ins and outs of my car anyway, I figured this could, in the long run, become a good learning experience.

This has got me looking around trying to figure out what kinds of mods and part replacements would actually be useful and practical to consider and eventually invest in. I’m not looking to try to get 250+ HP or anything crazy out of it; just looking for wrench time and part swaps that could be put in that would improve reliability, fuel economy, etc... You know, the useful daily stuff. I drive it hard on city streets, but don’t tend to speed by much, and I don’t usually break 90 on a freeway unless it’s just totally empty. So what would be some things to look at, or at least plan on dealing with eventually?

2078,I just bought a 2015 FIAT 500 Abarth.,Doooshty,"I came from a 2006 G35 sedan, which had many more options, even bring 9 years older. It was faster. Had more seat room. The build quality is cheap on the Fiat. Lots of low quality plastic. A piece of the trim is disintegrating. 

I don't care. 

It's been a long time since I had a car that caused me to be legitimately sad because I had to go to work and couldn't drive it. I had the urge to go outside on my lunch just to listen to the exhaust. The Abarth is FAR from the perfect car. It's perfect where it matters to me though. Maybe over long term, years of dealing with it that will change but for now I absolutely adore this tiny little Italian. I got it at a substantial amount off because it sat on the lot forever I'm pretty sure it had to do with the fact that the previous owner had custom pink and black leather katzkin seat covers installed. I'm not too proud to dive with my ass in a pink seat. Lol

2099,Drilled and Slotted 500 Abarth Brake Upgrade Questions,Leo_br00ks,"Originally posted this to a facebook group so for reference I live in the Denver area and drive a 2014 500 Abarth. Here is a picture of my latest color shift: https://imgur.com/mbinq5f
I have an odd question about brakes but I’m sure it’s a common one? I’m looking to upgrade my brakes to drilled and slotted rotors and ceramic pads. What should this cost? Short of going full Brembo(2k+), I’m just curious. 
I found a set of what I’m looking for on BrakePerformance for like $250. Reviews seem to be positive on the individual set as well as the site as a whole. This is a bit cheaper than I’ve seen on more specialty sites like 500madness which are around $500 and up to $800 for pads and rotors. Seeing as the reviews are good for both products, should I have any issues going for the $250 set? I should mention that all the information I found on drilled and slotted rotors like chamfering the holes is done on the cheaper option as well and a lifetime warranty for warping and cracking, I can’t see an immediate reason why they’re so much cheaper. 
On the installation front, what should I be looking at? I have no idea on what labor should cost, but the Big O that has been the nicest to me and my car said they’ll install brakes I buy myself because they don’t carry any drilled etc for the 500 Abarth I drive. How much should that cost? If anyone has any shop recommendations etc as well let me know.
I would love to get input on this, both on the rotors and the installation.",2,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/8f84za/drilled_and_slotted_500_abarth_brake_upgrade/,1524794549,8f84za

Gave it some time to, I don't know, recalibrate and without taking it out of park or pressing on the break itself, turned my ignition on. Voila, I thought... until I pressed the break so I could take it out if park. Then it pops back up!

I replaced both stop lamp bulbs in the rear to be sure, besides, they came in a two pack. The turn signal lights operate normally as do the third lights on those rear things.

Daytime running bulbs appear to be fine.

I checked all relevant fuses.

2104,Does anyone know how many electric Fiat 500 models there are and what the differences are? It's confusing.,higgs8,"I live in Hungary and I keep seeing more and more ""Fiat 500e"" cars. They look really awesome, and they all have the ""500e"" clearly marked on the side and inside on the right side of the dash.

I'm also seeing some used electric Fiat 500 cars being sold online, reportedly manufactured in 2010, but they don't have the ""e"" marking. They have a charging port behind the front Fiat logo that just pops off, rather than where the fuel door is with the new ones. Each one only has very few kilometers in it, ranging from 18 000 to 30 000 km. Some have had multiple owners. It seems suspicious that an 8 year old car only has 18 000 km in it and has had 2 owners, why? The 500e seems to be a good car and being practically free to run, why would someone own it but not use it for 4 years, sell it, and then the new owner would do exactly the same and also not use it for 4 years, and then sell it too? Makes no sense.

Here are photos of the ones I'm seeing online: [imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/eMKu7xC)

These all go for what is the equivalent of about $11 800, which is significantly cheaper than any used electric car available here. Especially one with so few kilometers in it.

Could these used ones advertised online be some kind of 3rd party electric conversions that don't work so well for whatever reason (maybe poor battery or motor performance)? They seem too cheap to be true, and too old and too little-used and too many owners to be a good idea to buy. They do seem to be in great condition and they have lots of surprisingly high-end extras, like pedestrian airbags and headlights that follow your steering, which is unusual in this car (unless they're not unusual in the 500e?).

2107,My '05 fiat panda 1.1 active is broken and no garages seem to know how to fix it. Any help? :(,MissMichaelJackson,"Hi guys. I have an '05 fiat panda. It's my first car and I bought it less than a year ago with 16,000 miles. It had one owner, an old lady who barely used it and kept it in her garage.

I've been having a lot of problems with it since December. First, the battery wasn't holding charge, so I bought a new battery thinking that the battery was broken. It drained that battery too and so a garage put a new alternator in it.

It worked alright for a little while and then started acting up. Struggling to start some days. Then a month or two ago it just started stalling whenever I was going slow and wouldn't start again. Since then, I've took it to a garage who kept it for a while, tried replacing the vehicle speed sensor then told me he couldn't fix it and gave it back to me. Then I tried fixing it myself by doing lots of googling, adding some cataclean and changing the air filters. (I know NOTHING about cars.)  It continued stalling whenever I drove, but it started up again this time. I've just taken it to another garage and they took it out for a drive and no error codes were coming up and they couldn't find anything wrong with it - which is annoying because some days it works alright and then some days whenever you come to a junction or traffic lights it stalls straight away. 

Now it's still at the garage, the MOT has run out and I've been without a car for months because nobody seems to be able to figure out what's wrong with it. I'm really upset because it's hardly got any miles on it and I love the car. Just thinking I don't have much choice at this point than to get a new car. Which is such a shame. 

Has anybody else had this issue with the Panda? Does anybody know any ideas of what could be wrong with it?

Thanks guys!!

I fell in love with the Fiat 500 Abarth from the second I heard it fire up in the lot. The main things they are worried about is it's snow performance and it's size. They are worried that, since I live in Michigan, it won't be able to hold up to the snow. Size wise, they're worries that semis will not be able to see me, even though when I drive I ensure that truck drivers know if my presence (keeping visual contact with the trucks rear views, using turn signals (like you should) and passing at safe distances). They also believe that it is unsafe, despite it's similar size to my current car. There is one near me for $10,000 and I am very interested. I need some of Reddits input on how I convince them to let me get that 500 Abarth

2176,Took the dive and got a 13 abarth,hAReverv,"So after some research I finally decided to go with a 2013 abarth.

after test driving it and doing a little research I came across a certified preowned 13' abarth. first time with such a small car and first time buying from a dealer CPO.


I've had it for about a week and a half now and I am really loving the car. it does great on gas and is a riot to drive. The sound is great, it's comfortable for me( im 5ft 10in). 

The audio, even with the beats system, is actually kind of hallow. I'm still working on tuning it to my liking, but I haven't seemed to be able to get it to not hurt you ears if its louder.

However the gti had a 12in sub powered by a 600watt amp... so maybe I can't compare.

I believe it's shortcomings do not really affect me as I was able to do two weeks worth of grocery shopping and the size has not inconvenienced me in anyway. I'm coming from an 08' stage 1 two door GTI.

I have noticed however the sunroof rattles more than expected when going over bumps. I have read that the tracks can be lubed and this usually fixes it.

not sure if this type of thing would be covered under any kind of warranty that would allow me to simply take it to the dealership and have them look at it. gonna call them tomorrow and ask what is covered etc.

also, I've noticed a rather loud popping when going over larger bumps on the freeway and ever around town.

It sounds like something something strut area? I read a thread here and someone linked to this http://www.autoserviceprofessional.com/article/94750/popping-fiat which seems like its possible.

I actually brought this up to the salesmen after test driving it and him and his manager went out and looked at it and said that the rear seats had not been locked all the way and that is what was causing it. I should have went out and tested it gain...

I did check the coolant hoses and they seemed clear of cracking or rigged fixes. 

the drivers side side skirt is ever so slightly separating.

Would taking an exacto knife without remvoing the entire side skirt and removing the current adheasive slightly and applying more 3m adheasive tape work? or should I have the dealership look at that too?

again I have to call and find out what is covered under the cpo warranty, but hopefully these two things would be covered and be able to be taken care of...?

other than that I really like the little car.

Thanks!

tl;dr

thanks!

----

Currently I have a 07 vw mkv gti with the following mods..

156k miles

apr stage 1 tuning

koni orange struts

oem+ springs

neuspeed cai

10in sub in trunk

backup camera

pioneer touchscreen headunit

I am starting to have problems with the gti such as on a cold start the turbo? is making a strange noise when pressure is release. almost sounds like grinding gears if the noise was produced by air.

bent wheel, not related but causing major vibration throughout vehicle making dash rattle worse than normal and cruising at 70 feels like i'm fighting to stay in the lane. 

3 seconds without holding the steering wheel im half way in the other lane. alignment or just bent wheel?

right axle may need to be replaced. not sure on that because I had taken it to a garage due to the left axle needing to be replaced and they said the right will probably be next.

Abs speed sensor driver side needs to be replaced. Abs and tc aren't working currently. 

fear of turbo blowing. I don't rag on the car too much, but certainly give the go every so often just to remind myself its a fun car.

but  that might be the problem. i've had it for about 5 years now and I'm looking for something else.

Money is kind of tight, so if I could sell the gti or trade it in and get a car with lower mileage and is newer I might avoid headache in the future. 

I am considering the following..

13-14(prefer 14) fiat abarth. 

size isn't a problem. my gti is the 2 door, its just my girlfriend and I, not often driving friends. my back seat hasn't been used in minimum 10 months. 

I mainly drive highway (55-85mph) about an 1.5 hours/day. but I live in the mountains and have plenty of curvy road options home. 

we do get a lot of snow but that's not that bad. I'd get snow tires and I usually don't drive in any more than 3 inches or stay home. worse case take the gf's awd suv that has snows.

I'm looking at a few that are 2013 abarth $9500 44k miles. I'd prefer a 2014, but I haven't seen many under $12. 

The fiesta st is also another one. Idk about how fun compared to the abarth. probably more reliable and makes more sense. However I can't really find many under $12k. 2014 $12900 51k miles. I mean maybe if I could talk them down to even $12. but that might be stretching it. 

focus st is slightly more than the fiesta as well.

I wouldn't mind a speed3, but finding one in the condition I want has proven to be difficult. 

then there's another gti. again.. fun factor I guess . I found a 2012 for just under $10 with 69k miles. base models, but heated seats. 

If I went gti I feel like I would just end up trying to re-mod it to what I have currently. whereas the abarth comes essentially modded from the factory. 

any other suggestions?

I'm taking the gti to get the wheels fixed this weekend so hopefully that helps the major vibrations.  

Then I'll take it to the garage and have them poke around and see if anything major is wrong and to check out the right axle, check alignment...?

maybe fixing my gti will scratch whatever itch i've got cause don't get me wrong I do like my gti, it makes the best turbo noises and is great around the corners, passing on the highway or just crusing. but my last two cars seemed to have been the ""sensible choice"" mazda3 2.3l, gti.

 so currently I have a 07 vw mkv gti with the following mods..

apr stage 1 tuning

koni orange struts

oem+ springs

neuspeed cai



however it is starting to get old and up there in mileage so I was looking at my options 

The fiat 500 abarth seems really well priced as I found some that were around $9.5-$10.5 with 20-30k miles which is in my price range.



**my concerns** would be I mainly drive highway (55-85mph) about an 1.5 hours/day.

How does the 500 abarth deal with cruising at 80mph? I know the stock exhaust is rather loud and I would be concerned about droning with only being a 5 speed.

my gti I almost never hear the exhaust unless I'm really high in the rpm. I hear my turbo more than anything which i love.



**The other concern** would be how it handles in the snow.

I live in an area where it snows a decent amount but have always had snow tires; i'd consider no different if I had the fiat.

I have 4 blizzak snow tires on my gti currently and do not have much problem in the snow within reason.



Thanks for the input.

first, sorry for any mistakes, english is not my native language.

I am currently in Portugal with a Fiat Ducato 290 Camping Car and it broke down. The workshop told me i have to get the replacement parts because they don't have them in stock.
I was able to organize all the parts except the axle sleeve. Now i've found one that fits for a 4001/549 (HST/TSN). The car i have is a 4001/547.

Does anyone know if this would work anyway?

2246,My fiat is a lemon,FortniteIsBroken,"It's about 3:20am and I'm sitting here thinking about how I should have never bought a Fiat 500.

It all started with a 2012 Fiat 500 at 30,000km or so, was still under warranty, (5yr/100k) I had a problem with a knocking noise on the FL suspension part, I took it in and they kept saying it was the bushings. So I had the bushings changed, a few days later problem showed up again (knocking noise - this was around 60,000km) every time I took it in they kept saying it was the bushings and they kept being worn, so I kept getting them replaced and the problem kept persisting. Fast forward to 103,000km (give or take) the problem is still there and I have an appointment scheduled, I get my oil change, lightbulb fixed, and I ask them to check out the problem again, finally they tell me that I have a swaybar that is pushed to the side and that is what the knocking is coming from - I figured ""okay great it should be covered under warranty because I have been complaining about this since 60,000km"" to my surprise the answer I got was ""we cannot cover the repair because it is past your warranty and it is void"".... I kept explaining it to the managers etc but they kept giving me the run-around finally I got fed up and I haven't taken my fiat back there since... I wish I could pursue this and get the repairs that I deserve, should I really be punished for the incompetence of the service techs at the dealership and how they could not diagnose the correct problem until the timing was just so happened to be after my warranty had expired? My fiat feels like I am driving a 99 honda civic with a really lowered and stiff suspension even though the whole car is bone STOCK. I have come to the conclusion that all Fiat related products are lemons and should be treated as such. Something seems fishy and I wish I knew who to escalate this to like some sort of customer service where they actually give a shit. (Since 100k there have been several problems - sunroof opens and closes halfway, trunk sometimes doesn't open at all, right passenger door handle has fallen off, wiring for the front headlight is faulty, suspension makes a creaking noise when I take turns say at an intersection or something of that nature, in the winter the electronics failed so bad the dash was half illuminated and you could only read half of the things on it, the suspension of this car feels like I am driving a honda civic that is fully gutted, exhaust has a leak in it, the paint on the strip above the windshield is chipping off (it's a 2012 model it should not be), paint chips on the hood, my windshield wiper has fallen off,  the arm rest insert has fallen off, the roof trim leaks when it rains heavily, the electronics in the trunk also malfunction and flicker the ""Hatchback open"" sign and I can hear the unlocking and the locking of the trunk lock but I am not pressing it, and then today I got the battery logo on the dashboard and my power-steering doesn't work so the car is basically in limp mode. I don't even know if I should fix all of these problems because I don't expect the car to be reliable enough to make it past 200k (it is at 130,000km)... Should probably turn the car into a demolition derby car because that is all it is good for. With that being said; I should have bought a fuckin' smart fortwo.

2247,Fiats with Mopar Max Care lifetime warranty,ticklemejoviemo,"I bought a new Fiat 500L &amp; Abarth in April 2015. My brother bought a new 500L in May 15 w/ Max care lifetime warranty ($2,000). He now has 170k miles on his and hasn't really had any major issues and only last week started dipping into his extended care coverage, window switch, window regulator, serp belt tensioner, right door speaker). 

I'm nearing the end of basic on both of mine and was quoted several prices for MaxCare of which the dealer I bought from quoted the least due to my business. Under $2k for the automatic 500L &amp; $3,100 for the Abarth, both $100 deductable. Also, if many things are wrong with vehic &amp; you bring it in for all, you only pay the $100 deduc.

What do you guys think about extended warranties? I've never owned new cars so this is new to me. Also, keep in mind this is factory Chrylser warranty not 3rd party, unlimited time &amp; mileage. My 500L had the transmission module replaced under basic last year, my primary concerns are auto trans., turbos, ECM's and obviously engines. Any info greatly appreciated.

2261,Odd Question about Bilstein Coilovers on a 500 Abarth,Leo_brooks,"Hi!
I bought a 500 Abarth about 6 months ago and have put about 8k Miles on it while living in the city (come on it just begs to be driven) and was recently in the shop replacing a headlight (I know I know I should do myself and save some money) and one of the techs saw my suspension and said wow I have that in my car it’s amazing and said that it’s a 3k coilover situation. I knew it had modded suspension and was lowered but I never asked what it was besides what brand and was it reliable. 
The obvious answer is that it is Bilstein B16s available on 500 madness (https://shop.500madness.com/fiat-500-abarth-cid114/suspension-and-brakes-cid121/suspension-upgrades-cid267/fiat-500-coilover-kit-by-bilstein-b16-pss10-adjustable-north-american-model-pid3413) but I noticed the B14s for a third of the price. (https://shop.500madness.com/fiat-500-abarth-cid114/suspension-and-brakes-cid121/suspension-upgrades-cid267/fiat-500-coilover-kit-by-bilstein-b14-pss-north-american-version-pid2103) Is it possible that I have B14s and how would I differentiate them? And perhaps more importantly, what is the actual difference between the two? A quick search shows that the 16s are adjustable (being coilovers I assume that means adjusting the coil height with a wrench etc.) why can’t that be done with the 14s though? 
I’m a noob in this world, and would love an actual explanation and not just criticism for either spending 3k on something that is the same as a 1k solution even though I wasn’t the one spending it or buying a car without knowing what modded suspension it has. Oh and if you couldn’t tell from the links Im in the US and my car is a 2014. Thanks

Tl/dr: what’s the difference between bilstein B16s and B14s for a 500 Abarth and how justifiable is a 200% increase in price? And how would I know if I have the 14s or the 16s?",3,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/7x7cvd/odd_question_about_bilstein_coilovers_on_a_500/,1518501097,7x7cvd

2268,Abarth/Turbo Shopping,r_dawson_25,"Hi! I'm new here and I wanted to ask some Fiat owners a few questions in regards to buying a second hand North American (Canadian specifically) Fiat 500 Abarth or Turbo, and what kind of reliability/problems I can expect.

First off, I drive on average about an hour, twice a day, 4 times a week (about 80km a day) so I will be clocking a fair bit of mileage. I also need the car to last me at minimum 4 years because I'm buying a condo in a few months won't be able to afford a new car any time soon. This limits my budget to about $12,000 CAD which isn't a lot, but there are a few options available for me. 

For the turbo's I'm a bit spoiled for choice as the average mileage is between 40-60,000km (25-37,000 miles) for ones in my price range, but for the Abarth, only 2012-2013's are available, and all the options I have are over 100,000km (62000 miles)! For obvious reasons I would prefer an Abarth, but will settle for the turbo if necessary. I'm just concerned with reliability. My GF has had a 500 now for 4 years and it has been relatively problem free, but she only drives in town and its never more than 5 or 6 minutes on the road. Not sure how well these vehicles would hold up to the amount of driving I do, especially with higher mileage models. 

TL:DR Want to buy an abarth/turbo but high mileage and reliability is a concern. Would like to hear real world opinions from owners before I pull the trigger.

It's a 2014, so it's out of manufacturer warranty. From what I've heard, most of the 500 issues are with the 2012 models. It also sounds like most of the other issues that keep the 500 from having a top of the line reliability rating is fairly minor stuff, like the battery going bad after a couple years.

The Fiat badge is making me want to grab the offered warranty on the one I'm looking at. It would cost $1700 for 5 years of warranty and up to 75,000 miles (so about 50,000 miles for me to drive). I generally drive under 10k miles a year, so it would last the whole 5 years. Covers everything except, oil, tires, and brakes. Allegedly it also covers the clutch but I have doubts. I would definitely read the fine print for that before signing.

Since the Fiat uses a lot of mopar parts, it should be fairly cheap for repairs, right? Maybe some increased labor time because of the cramped engine bay?

Thanks in advance for any input. The 500 Abarth is quite exciting and I'm hoping I can snag it without it being financial suicide.

EDIT: One more note, I'm looking at a convertible Abarth. Generally soft tops and the associated motors are expensive to replace as far as I'm aware.",9,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/7w16kr/thinking_about_getting_a_fiat_should_i_buy_a/,1518052860,7w16kr

I ordered the bulbs and a replacement socket for the melted one. The only flaw in my plan is that somehow the “for off-road use only” LED bulbs are somehow way less bright than the incandescent ones.

2) I cant seem to find a 2017 anywhere near me. I'd likely have to fly out of state to pick one up. Are these cars really that rare?

3) Would I be jumping the gun if I were to buy this summer, as opposed to January 2019 when the 2019s come out? I'd like the price to be close as possible to $20k. I'm not sure if an extra 7 months or so would make a huge difference.

One of the pros of having an electric motor is the cost.

I have a 2013 Fiat 500c Lounge Edition that is a salvage title. The vehicle was totaled in 2014 by the original owner. It was hit in the rear right fascia. It was sold at a salvage auction and the previous owner bought it and repaired it himself since he is a mechanic. We got the vehicle in May of 2015 and it has always had the Service Airbag Sensor light on. My guess is because it was in an accident and the original airbags deployed but Im wondering if there is more to it than that. 

I really dont want to have the harness under the seat replaced as that would take days at the shop to repair plus like $2600. The problem either lies with the sensor by the oil filter or by the wiring underneath the seat from what I could gather from the forums on their site. Help?

2376,"Thinking about a ""used"" Fiat 500c (x-post r/cars)",fricknut,"Okay so a dealership near me recently bought some unsold Fiat 500c's from a dealership out of state. The particular car I am looking at is a 2015 Fiat 500c considered ""used"" with only 70 miles on it. (For the record, yes they all have around the same milage) But, yes. Only 70. And it is being offered at 11,985. So I see it as a new car being labeled as used because it is just older. 

So my question to you guys is, do you think that this would be a good purchase? I am going to ask them to put it up on a lift to make sure that the undersides are fine after sitting for 2 or three years. Do any of you have any important questions to ask them about before considering purchase? I have been looking for a new car over the past few months and this deal kinda just popped into my view. 

I currently drive a 2004 Honda Element AWD that I love, but my issue with the Fiat is the lack of AWD. How do they tend to handle in snow? I live in North East, OH and we get a good amount of snow from time to time. I have heard that snow tires and a bag of sand or two in the trunk really helps, and I would probably end up doing that, but are there any other issues with snow driving I should be aware of? 

Overall, anyone with a 2015 Fiat 500c, what issues are you having, do you recommend the car, and what should I expect out of the car if I were to go through with the purchase? 

Anyone else is free to leave feedback, but Fiat owners and dealers especially would be awesome. Thank you all in advance!!

I thought maybe I was being sloppy and not putting the clutch in all the way so I started double clutching.  Shortly thereafter, the car would not engage 3rd at all.

I am able to depress the clutch and put the shifter in 3rd, but as soon as I start letting out the clutch (I have tried this at all speed and RPM conditions) it either grinds or pops into neutral.  I took it into my local dealer and they said it was a bad synchro and that it would be 2200 to replace the synchros, but if there was other damage, 3k for a whole new transmission.

The service writer was not able to explain to me why I could not engage 3rd even with double clutching (nor could he engage it).  I have driven several unsynchronized manuals and am always able to get in by double clutching.

What is stranger is that after maybe 100 miles of 1-2-4-5 shifting, I accidentally shifted into 3rd and it engaged once.  Next time I tried no luck.  After a bunch of miles ignoring 3rd, I was able to get in 3rd again, but only a couple of times.

If it would, what all would I need to have it installed (i.e. Double din adapter kits, harnesses, etc.) I'd like to keep steering wheel controls as well. Any and all help is greatly appreciated. I'm rather dumb when it comes to this stuff. Thanks again!

2412,School me please,KeepingAnEyeOnEvery1,"So I am leaning towards getting a 500 Abarth. I love the look and the sounds well, you know. My trouble is I am super cheap and commitment phobic so I tend to not often finance my cars.  I have decided it may be the time to do so and I have several Abarths in my  scope but don't know which to pull the trigger on.

I see some 2016 models that are leftover that have decent prices on them, one nearby has 1k miles on it which seems high for a ""new"" car.
I see several used 2013 models from 8k to 13k and some around 10.5k that have around 25k to 45k miles on them.  

The frugal part of me says buy an older one, save 10 grand and cross your fingers nothing major breaks.  The sensible side says get a new one, get the peace of mind of a warranty and just pay now so you don't pay later in larger chunks.

UGH, what to do? Also wondered if there is any breakdown on colors, I see a lot of a few colors but hardly see any in certain ones. Is there some more rare or were they just more popular then others? 

I am sure I will have more questions later.

So for starters I'm in the states, since from what i have been able to read that makes a difference, and i live in the north east. Been reading about areas to check for rust that would make the car, not worth messing with except for a parts car. Seems like there is a drain area between the engine cover and rear window? Something about plastic inspection caps? I can't seem to find anything showing these. The other big spot i read to worry about is where the rear suspension attaches. Are there any other big spots that may not be overly straight forward? Any major mechanical things to watch out for? I know the car has been sitting a good length of time (+/-10 years) so i know it will need a REAL good going thru, but the engine does turn over. I'm sure that I've forgotten things but I'm hoping that you all can help. Thank you for your time",1,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/7gwrbv/advice_on_about_a_79_x19/,1512151277,7gwrbv

I have a 500 2012 Sport and it's been giving me trouble lately and I wonder if anyone else has seen the following issues:

I had something similar happen when the car was new, and I know there was a recall for grounding the starter properly, which resolved it for a couple years. I'm wondering if the starter failed and there's a short somewhere.

2463,2013 Fiat 500 pop Bucking issues,steveo2400,"Hey all, 
I've taken my 500 (manual, base model) to several mechanics including the dealer I bought it from to take a swing at this issue, but they have been unable to replicate it. I have a 25 mile drive each way to work; about 20 of it is highway. When I get off the highway, the car will buck when I reach an RPM where I would normally shift. Meaning I will accelerate from first and be about to shift into second, and it will start to buck. If I shift, I'm good until I get to that same point in second gear. If I don't, it will continue to buck. I haven't pushed it too hard, so I'm not sure what will happen if I don't ever shift. This bucking happens at the end of every gear right before i would normally shift, and happens in 5th as well. The weird thing is, all I have to do is turn the car off and on again and it will stop. 

As I said, no mechanic has been able to replicate it. I picked up my local mechanic once while it was happening, but he doesn't have very much experience with fiats and doesn't have an idea. I'm hoping one of you fine people might.

Was driving home from work and lost power. Pulled over, read the code. P0302. Sweet, look at that spark plug and see what’s up, right? Pulled the plug and it looked crushed, I thought that was pretty weird, but I got all new plugs and started the car. Still misfiring. Look at coil packs and they fired, but just for giggles, got a new one, still misfiring. Pulled the injectors and went and unclogged/clean them. They all operated correctly and their spray was clean and even. Put them back in and we’re still misfiring. Test to see if the injector is receiving a signal to fire and it is. The spark plug on cylinder 2 is wet with fuel all these times after changing the plugs.

I thought this would be the best place to post this.  
To quite recently I got my first car, a 2007 fiat grande punto and I love it. However, it came installed with an aftermarket headunit, a Pioneer Avic X3 to be specific. Im not really a fan of this, as the bluetooth is a bit iffy and most of the features dont work, so I went out and brought a new one. However, upon trying to wire it, I can see that the sockets on the new one dont match the ones on the pioneer at all.  
I tried messing around with finding other wires, but I couldnt find anything. As well as that, plugging the avic back in now doesnt work either, so Im forced to install the new one.  
Heres some pictures that might help, cheers

2521,500X Trekking Plus feels very jerky when it automatically shifts... is this normal?,blondie232,"I got the 2016 500x trekking plus two days ago, so I am still getting used to it.  My first car (before this) was a PT Cruiser with automatic transmission.  

My Fiat has a '9 speed shiftable automatic' transmission.  I bought it from a used car dealership, so I didn't get much information on the specifics of the car since they aren't a fiat-only dealership.

I have noticed that when I drive and the car switches gears, it is quite jerky.  If I didn't know any better, I would think I was in a manual car- it gives that slight abrupt/lurching forward motion when the gears shift, like when you ride in a manual car.  This happens both when I speed up, and when I slow down to a stop- it lurches forward.  I have tried switching the mode from the normal mode to sport mode and it doesn't change anything.  

Is this normal for Fiat?  Or am I driving it the 'wrong' way?  I never felt my pt cruiser shift and it was always very smooth.

I am slightly paranoid about every little thing that is 'off' with this car- I read quite a few bad reviews on this car and the general consensus seems to be that people hate Fiat, so I am worried I made the wrong decision in getting this car.

2544,Any folks here familiar with the Fiat 500e (electric) Cali car?,magenta_placenta,"Looking for a new used car for city use only (possible commuting and short jaunts around town), limited driving as I'm not a big driver in general.

I currently commute on a commuter train so would only need the commuting aspect of the car in the future.

[I see these in my area with fairly low mileage for around $8k](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=&amp;formSourceTag=110&amp;entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=d2239&amp;zip=97201), wondering if there are folks here that are familiar with the car and what your general thoughts are.

Some basic research shows me they were only sold in California and Oregon (I'm in Oregon), range is around 84 miles on a full charge and a full charge on a standard 120 volt takes a full day (4 hours if you have a 240 volt). It's conceivable I could have a 240 volt outlet put in my garage as I'm pretty sure that's what my dryer is running on. I don't think I would need it with my driving lifestyle, though.

None of that seems like show stoppers for me. I also see some (I'm assuming 240 volt) chargers around town, most notably where I grocery stop so I could get a free 20 minute charge there every week.  I don't see them all over the place, though I'm not looking for them. I would know where they all were if I bought a car like this, though.

The technology isn't cutting edge on these, but that's why they're selling for &lt; $10k for recent year models.

The car is small, but I don't need it for cargo space. I actually like the *idea* of the size as I have a small garage, plus, I'm a minimalist.

Pretty sure I read the battery was warrantied for 8 years but I'm not sure if any warranty carries over to a 2nd owner.

Also, dumb question, but what kind of maintenance is required for an electric car?

Generally, what do you guys think of this model? What are the gotchas one needs to be aware of, hidden costs, maintenance, all that stuff.

2584,Having trouble getting dealership to honor extended warranty,Umasou,"Hi all,

I have a 2012 fiat 500 pop with about 40k miles on it with a busted rear wheel bearing. I bought the car about a year and a half ago with the extended warranty. The dealership and the warranty company are claiming the damage doesn't fall under the warranty because it doesn't cover rust damage. My argument is that there was a mechanical failure with the seal which allowed water to get in in the first place, and should therefore be covered by he warranty. Basically, my question is: do you think I have a valid point, or should I just give up and pay full price?

I'm okay with the $7800 out the door price. I'm just really unsure about the warranty because the price seems like a scam. The 4year mopar warranty would add an additional $59 a month to my financing costs. This would seriously increase the price of the vehicle.

The height adjustment lever doesn't actually change the height, it just tops the base up or down (either raising the knees/lowering the butt or the reverse) the only half comfortable position I can drive in is to have the seat too far forward so I can reach the clutch.

Should I be at all worried about the (no) warranty?

2642,"Me and my family have been stuck for a week in a parking lot south of Hamburg. Out RV has a broken back axle, unable to find a workshop that can or want to replace it. Language barrier I don't speak German. Need advice/help to get my RV fix and maybe also a bit of motivation. [x-post from r/Advice]",gabsinator,"Dear reddit I write to you in desperation.

I was talking my mom and my kids on the adventure of a lifetime, down to Chamonix and Italy for a month of climbing, hiking and exploring. I've been driving from Tromso, Norway and on the autobahn south of Hamburg the rear wheel flew of and hit the windshield of car going in the other direction. Thankfully nobody got hurt as I somehow managed to navigate the vehicle safely to the side of the motorway. Police informed me that everyone in the other car was fine, and not to worry.

We called a tow company and five hours later we got towed to a workshop nearby, it being Sunday and everything closed, we decided to camp out in the parking lot.

Monday I talked to the workshop and they where very helpful and told me they would order all the parts needed and get me on the road as soon as possible. I talked to my insurance and they agreed to send us to a hotel in Hamburg while the RV was being repaired.

Wednesday the workshop called me back and told me that he was unable to get the axle, he had found everything else, but the Fiat specialist next door said that it's impossible to get a rear axle for a 1999 Fiat Ducato 230. Back to square one.

I called my travel insurance to ask if I'm entitled to a rental RV just so I can get us back on the road, they said that that would be possible if I only had a prepaid booking at our destination. I do not, it defies the freedom of a RV.

So I contacted around 20 workshops, from Hamburg to Milan, and because of the language barrier most of them asked me to send an email. I have only received a response from three of them, all telling me their sorry they can't help, and with a recommendation to call Fiat Customer services or another workshop that was unable to help.

Thursday we had to leave Hamburg because of the G20 riots, our Hotel was right in the middle of it and my mom and kids felt unsafe. We traveled back to the RV to get some fresh clothes and to start calling people again.

I called Fiat and they said it should be no problem to get the parts, it's a standard axle used by Peugeot Boxers, Citroen Jumpers and many more. They would find me a workshop and get back to me, but haven't heard anything from them yet.

Friday I called my local RV workshop back in Norway and they confirmed that it should not be a problem to get the parts. They could order them and have them delivered to me, but it would take six weeks as their supplier is located in Germany.

The weekend coming up and figuring this could take some time to get sorted out, I asked my insurance if I could get town to a campsite (Suedsee-Camp) south of here, so that at least everyone would be comfortable while we wait, we have ran out of water and the chemical toilet in our RV has long been full. They agreed and said they would ordered me a tow truck for a RV and four passengers (13pm). So while we waited, we walked around the neighborhood and got a bit to eat, this is when I discovered that I left my debit card in the ticket machine in Hamburg, called my bank and got it blocked.

Around 20pm I was called by an tow-service asking me to confirm that we where three people and a car that needed to be town to the workshop we are currently located. I gave them the correct information (4 pax and a RV) and she told me that it was so late right now that they had no chance in getting us an English speaking driver, with a truck that big so late at night. are unable to help me. Ironically the tow truck that got us here is parked right in front of us.

Saturday (Right now), Still waiting for the tow truck and I'm about to give up. I feel cursed (don't believe in them) as everything I try seems to fail, the language barrier, opening hours and everything else is working against me, the whole trip started out with a Seagull shitting on my head, and since then everything has been Murphy. I'm the type of person that's not comfortable asking for help, but now I'm desperate.

Are there any kind, German speaking souls out there, that can assist me with finding a workshop that can order parts and replace my back axle and get us back on the road?

My hope is that I can have the RV town and fixed some where, some time next week during the next week, so that we can spend the few days we have left of our vacation on the adventure I originally planned.

TL;DR: I need to get in touch with a English or Norwegian speaking workshop that can get the parts needed and that can replace the back axle on my Fiat Ducato 230 RV. I'm currently located 45km or hopefully soon 100km south of Hamburg and my insurance will get me towed to where ever needed. By serious request I have pictures of the damages, all the technical information of the vehicle and contact info of the works manager in the workshop I'm currently parked at.

**Update:** A kind passer by came and looked at the damages, he said it's an easy fix and if I understood him correctly (we spoke Normanylish) he's gonna ask his son who's a mechanic and ask if he can replace the axle. Also still waiting for tow truck. 
With help from the kind people of /r/Germany I have found parts online, and I'm pretty sure I will find a workshop that can help me out during next week. :)

2654,The car I love vs. dealership I hate. Why so terrible? And where are all the Fiat technicians?,lemuelwashington,"I know that mileage varies when it comes to any brand's dealership. But yesterday was my first time officially going to a Fiat dealership. It's not really a Fiat dealership like it used to be. It's a Chrysler dealership that sells Fiats. But one of the few Chrysler dealerships in the area that services Fiats. 

This was for the clutch recall issue. Took two and a half weeks just to get an appointment. Went in yesterday morning at 7am, they said it would take a few (4-5) hours. After a few hours, the service desk was unreachable. The voicemail was full and they weren't answering the phone. So I left the car there overnight. Went back at 7am this morning. 

""Oh, your car is next. We just have to wait for our Fiat tech to come in."" 

Why is there only one Fiat tech? I watch a few people come and go before they get to my car. They finally get it done at 12:30pm. 

The people weren't rude and nasty, but just uncommunicative. When I got a hold of one of the service people and politely explained my frustration, he made sure to communicate what was going on with me.

But most of the dealership's Fiat problems seem to be related to the fact that there is a shortage of Fiat techs? Is this normal when a new manufacturer comes into the country? Did/does Mini experience this? Suzuki (when they existed)? 

I am dreading ever having to go back there again. This was something simple. If it was something serious, I'm afraid of how long it would take.

I currently have a Chevy Volt which has been incredibly reliable, but it's a second car now so stepping down in cost and up in electric range is tempting. My only concern boils down to two points: 1) Reliability, and 2) Battery degradation. Both I consider to be strong points of the Volt (and EV cars in general, minus degradation on the Leaf). It seems that the reliability issues stem from typical poor FCA quality control. Some 500e's are fine, some have issues. In that sense, a higher mileage example is tempting since that's a sort of indicator that it was at least reliable enough to get some good use. But that increases chances of battery degradation as well.

Would you have any misgivings about buying a used '13 or '14 with 25-35k miles (looking around $6000-$6500)? For those with higher mileage cars (35k+), what kind of range are you still able to get?

I have a Jeep Liberty and the window regulators on my car have broken THIRTEEN times since I've owned the vehicle. Jeep was willing to repair the first 12 and has since refused to offer to pay the $475 it would take to repair the next broken regulator.

2691,"How fun is the Abarth, particularly handling?",MattyDoodles,"So, I bought a 2016 KIA Forte 5SX 6 last August simply because I was going to do Lyft and wanted a Turbo/manual/hatch back.

Well, Lyft was stupid and won't be doing that. I now have a car that I didn't really want that's bigger than I like (traded a Smart four two and VW Turbo Beetle S).  The KIA has complete garbage for suspension.  KIA basically threw rock hard low profile 19s on a ""sport tuned"" suspension.  The ""sports tuning"" was taking a 100% completely stock Forte suspension and simply adding much stiffer spring that are a couple MM shorter and adding the larger rotors from a stock Optima, nothing more.  The torsion beam setup on the rear going into corners is complete digshit, and the few aftermarket options are horrendously expensive, and don't fix the issue, just lessen it. 

I do not race the car, I just enjoy cars with manuals and turbos when I can get one.  I'm taking corners at normal speeds on the roads and the suspension is so hard it chatters and bounces around in corners and I'm actually afraid to push it due to that plus horrid understeer.  Harshness and shit suspension is a known issue simply due to such it's stiffness, my dealership looked it over to ensure nothing was broken.

Now, in a straight line it's ""quickish"", but I'm averaging 17-20mpg because it's a thirsty Direct injection motor running a 18-20lb turbo that's making 201hp out of 1.6l.  It's ok, not lightning quick, and frankly the 6 speed is geared oddly making that 201hp pointless.  It's a 6 speed, but when driving it wants me to shift from 4 to 6. 5th and 6th are basically overdrive and 4th wants to rev really high.  

Now, I'm looking to replace this with a smaller, 2 door hatchback with a stick shift and looks like it's the Turbo 500 which appears to have been axed,
or the Abarth.

So, how's the power/transmission/suspension on the Abarth?  Things I should know?  I plan on buying new.  Would like leather and a good audio system.

How's the aftermarket on this car?

I took it to the dealer yesterday and they let me know that the brake rotors are worn but the brake pads themselves are at a normal 7 and 8mm.
I'm  happy to do my end of research on what can cause this, how to prevent it in the future and if it's a common issue but am unsure what online forum to post it in. Otherwise - I'd be really grateful to hear anyone's advice on the matter. It just seems so unusual to me that the rotors can be worn while the pads themselves are fine. Could the fact that the car was sitting about unused for a year before purchase contribute to the wearing of the rotors? Driving style?

My dad says that getting a red car is not a smart move because it starts to look old really fast.

There is a specific word to describe what I'm talking about, I just don't know it. 

I'm creating this post because I've found an afordable Grand Punto in a dark red color ([image of the car color](http://i.imgur.com/sUrIBlC.png)) and I'm hoping someone has a car with the same color after some years of use. 

And since my dad mentioned this about red cars, I couldn't stop noticing every single red car that passed by me and some of them actually were looking (I'm not sure if this is the right word) degraded/worn out/""burned"" from the sun.

Would be great if it were in black or white, but I can't seem to find a good deal at the moment.

2744,2016 500x pop manual 5k mile review,rainmister,"The Good; 
Turbo is awesome, it really takes off in 2nd and 3rd gear, plenty of power
seats are really comfortable, 
Handles great, holds road well, even in heavy rain( We had a lot in Norcal this winter)
Shifts really smoothly and easily
So far no problems
Parking brake is automatic
Price;  a steal at $13,500, with only 850 miles on it from a dealer with extra warranty

Not so good; 
Radio 3.0 was too basic, radio only, no phone interface or backup camera or cd. Upgraded to Kenwood with all the options for @$600, but aftermarket not as good as OEM with same features. (backup camera was needed, backed into a sign before adding camera). My 500 pop hatchback from 2012 had no need to upgrade as it had phone interface and CD

Passengers in rear seat complain of stiff suspension. A new European car feature apparently; you trade great handling for a bumpy ride in back d/t stiff suspension.

A little less in the storage and cupholder department than a lot of Small SUV's. A few fewer interior amenities compared with my 500 pop.

Mileage only @30/gallon with lots of highway driving. Blame that turbo! 500 pop I got 37/gallon.

All in All; fun to dive, roomy small SUV. Price hard to beat. totally reliable thus far and build seems good

In looking at new-to-me vehicles today, I test drove a 2014 500L at a good price. The ONE thing that didn't sell me on it, was how delayed a shift there was from stop-to-first. I'd hit the gas, the engine would rev, and then the transmission would catch. I asked the salesman if all the Fiat automatic transmissions were like this, and he said ""Yeah, they're an acquired taste."" Are they really that bad, or was this just a lemon?

To be more specific - I'd be at a complete stop, but still in drive. I'd hit the gas, and there was just no forward movement until the tranny caught in first gear. Felt just like dropping the clutch in a manual. Shifting through the other gears was decent (not super-smooth, but no vibrations or jarring).

Other than that...it was a very interesting car. I was *really* surprised by all the room inside. Ride height is good, backseat room is good, storage room is good, brakes worked fantastic.

I currently own a 2014 Fiat 500 Abarth. This car has 6000 miles on it. I bought the car as a Lemon Law Buyback car. (Biggest Mistake)

The car drove amazing off of the lot in September of 2016 with 500 miles. I had a great few weeks of it. Then, a domino effect of issues came up. The car has been to the dealer for warranty repairs 5 times. Most of this was before the oil change.
A case was open with FIAT, but none of the techs could ""verify customers concern"" so there were no repairs made this last time.

The Chrysler dealer I bought the vehicle from has had me in multiple loaner cars. They have just offered me a trade for a 2015 500 Turbo. 

The Turbo is Red and I am really into the clean styling. I may miss my abarth.

This is my abarth

2850,Audio Questions,NoMuffinForYou,"New owner of 2015 500 Abarth and I have some questions about the Alpine audio system in it.  

1.) I don't think the stock system sounds terrible, but I'd read on some forums that the Alpine and Beats systems use the same amplifier (same part # apparently) and that the Alpine system has the powered subwoofer channels, just nothing hooked up to them (wiring harnesses there and everything).  Some posters said they worked, some said they didn't and some said they'd investigate and never updated again.  So I was wondering if there was any consensus on that because I'd like to add a sub without having to do much modding.   

2.) I was considering just replacing the door/rear speakers and stopped by a local car audio shop (it's 15F outside, I'm getting them installed lol) and when I said it has Alpine audio they said that if you swap anything out you have to replace EVERYTHING.  Essentially they said that if the Alpine amp senses the wrong impedance it just shuts down?  Now, to me this sounds like pure bullshit because the guy didn't know that a 2ohm speaker is harder for an amp to drive than a 4ohm but I figured I'd also ask if anyone's had issues swapping speakers and having the stereo stop working?

TL;DR
1.) Alpine amp- sub channels work? Y/N?
2.) Door speaker swaps- any issues or is the installer guy full of shit?

Second, I like to mountain bike frequently, so I'd have to buy a roof rack. Any suggestions?

this question is mostly about Alfa Romeo but since these FIRE engines are used in Fiat/GM vehicles as well I thought I might just ask here.
Is there much of a difference in feel between these two engines (2009 vs 2012)? Is the 7kw (10hp) in favour of the MultiAir engine enough to justify the additional failure rate?

When the car is on (engine running or engine not running with key in acc/on position) and I'm listening to music, the large driver side speaker doesn't work, and there's no bass from the whole left side of the car. But when I turn the key to OFF all speakers work as they should. Is this possibly a feature of the Uconnect 5.0 radio where it mutes the driver side speaker to reduce errors in voice commands when a phone is connected? It mentions nothing about this in the user guide. And yes, I already made sure audio balance is centered.


So obviously something is killing the signal to the speaker once the key is turned from OFF to ACC/ON. Maybe there's a faulty relay or something?

2893,"Just bought a 2012 500 Pop, already having a bit of buyers remorse...",Pizzadilla,"Hello Fiat Enthusiasts!

I pulled the trigger this morning and bought a 2012 Fiat 500 pop at a local dealer. I was super excited about it and had done a ton of research and ended up getting it for about $600 lower than the blue book fair price. It has just over 48,000 miles on it and the tires were a little less than 50 percent tread so the dealer offered to replace them (which is happening now). I haven't gone back to pick it up but I already am feeling nervous. I signed everything so it's not like I can back out, but I was hoping to come here and get a little bit of peace of mind about what I am in for from people who know it best.



I did get an extended warranty from my financial institution that is pretty good and long term, so I am not necessarily nervous about major mishaps that might be covered through them, but it is more about the reliability and safety on the road. I haven't had a car for about a year because for a while I lived right next to a major transportation hub and it was awesome. I was able to reduce my environmental footprint and save money until I moved to my latest neighborhood. The car I had before I sold it was a newish toyota, which was the worst car I've ever owned. I took it in for no less than 8 recalls and it had a bunch of related but not covered by warranty things happen, like my windshield wipers flying off on the interstate and my horn no longer working after only about 30,000 miles. I owned it for 6 years and it had so many problems that I thought of selling it basically from day 1. So I would like to avoid that mess again.



I am also nervous about finding a good mechanic who takes fiats. There is a fiat dealer in the area but I have always had good experiences and relationships with local, independent mechanics.



The reason I chose this car is because of the small size (30s, no kids and mostly driving solo) and great gas milage (and cuteness, I have to admit). I also liked the price, as I do not need anything heavy duty or fancy because I will still walk/bus/bike when I have the chance. I walk to work most days but where I am living now it is hard to get to almost anything else and the weather is pretty gross, so I just need something to ride around town to run errands and go to friends houses, etc. I know eventually that I would like to get a fully electric car, but because of my housing situation (multifamily unit, no garage or plug) it's not in the cards yet, and hybrids are just too expensive for me. So any longer term or used fiat experience you have would be wonderful! Anyone have the same feelings after buying, and have it turn out well?

I've been rolling with the piggy-back for a while because it was easy to install and perfect for light modifications but now I'm looking at getting into the 250-260whp range. To reach those numbers I will have to go with an ECU flash. Once I have the money to move over to the flash-tuner I will be uninstalling my Road Race Motorsports piggy back and it will be for sale. PM me if you are interested and we can work out a price. I can also send pictures if someone was interested but it is still in the car so they wouldn't show much. Thanks for looking and if I am not supposed to selling stuff on here let me know and I will remove the post. Thanks for reading!

I am in the market for my second Fiat 500 Abarth.  This time used is the name of the game and daily driver.  I have a Fiat 500 Pop ""Ribelle"" as my current daily with a Focus ST as the fun car.

I used to own an Abarth before the ST, loved it but the depreciation made me super sad.  I want to get back in one now but after someone else already ate all the up front cost.  

I have my eyes set on getting the 500c Abarth also.  That said I have a request for anyone out there who owns the C already.  I would like a close up picture of the roof track.  Trim piece along the headliner and above to the roof.   It's a part of the car I can't see easily myself as there are no close dealers, and one not many people focus on when photographing the car. 

While I am making requests does anyone that has a C have specific cautionary advise?

Also when you hit the pedal limiter it makes a dull, hollow sounding thud. I hope it holds up because I'm keeping this car for a while longer. I want to hear what other people have experienced.

2989,Local Fiat dealer continues to let me down,bubba_OBLIVION,"Hey guys, so I took my car in for a regular oil change + complimentary inspection last week. Today I took it for the state inspection, and they discovered a massive break fluid leak, and my break fluid at the minimum point of fullness. I called the dealer to ask why they didn't inform me of this issue (though they took the time to tell me of tons of other insignificant ones), and was informed that they just didn't do the inspection. No reason why, just an ""I'm sorry this happened."" This isn't the first time I've had issues with the dealer, but unfortunately this is the only one within reasonable distance to me (and even then it's about a 30-45 minute drive to get to it). I'm just wondering if there's anything I can do here? Someone that I can complain to that will actually listen to me and help me solve this issue? They want me to bring my car to them so they can reexamine it and actually do the inspection, but with no break fluid I'm not going to be driving it down the highway anytime soon. Unfortunately it looks like the only place I can get the parts is through the dealer- whom I'd rather not be giving anymore money to at this point. 

It should be noted that I bought my car used, 3rd party. It had a warranty intact when it was purchased but it ran out 5000 miles ago, since it wasn't purchased at the dealer I don't have access to their complimentary towing or loaner cars.

I don't fully understand how the charging aspect works. I know it gets about 87 miles per charge (which seems terrible IMO) but obviously more suited for a city commute. But how do these charging stations work? What is the fee to use them? Do they only offer the level 2 charge? how long do they take to charge at a station if so? I will be staying in California for a month bouncing around from Irvine, to LA, and to San Diego. Can I reliably drive to all of these places without charging headaches?

2997,2012 manual grinding on 3rd gear - possibly related to recall on manual transaxle clutch?,lifelongwobbly,"I have a 2012, 6-speed manual with 89k miles which is grinding when going into 3rd gear. Apparently the syncro is going bad. 

The clutch was completely replaced under warranty at 40k miles.

There is an active recall for the manual transaxle clutch: https://www.chrysler.com/universal/webselfservice/pdf/S34.pdf.

It states: ""The clutch cover diaphragm spring on your vehicle may fatigue and/or fracture. A
failed clutch cover diaphragm spring may result in the inability to disengage the clutch,
shift gears and the potential for a loss of motive power.""

Is it possible that this is related? 

I've had to pay diagnostic fees to one mechanic and the dealer, and the dealer told me that they couldn't do the recall repair as the parts weren't out. Both told me that I would need a complete replacement of the transmission, which starts at around $1500 with the mechanic.

FCA also refused to reimburse me for the diagnostic fee since the parts weren't out yet for the recall.

The engine revs as it's supposed to, but when I start to release the clutch I can hear a weird rubbing sound. Almost as if two smooth pieces of metal were were being rubbed together with too much force. When I hear it I engage the clutch again, but when I release the clutch again the noise is gone. 

I took it to the dealer, but they were not able to replicate the problem. There is nothing wrong with the car otherwise. In the past month I've heard that sound 3 times and it's only briefly. Aside from the the clutch does its job quite smoothly.

So I have a 2009 Fiat Grande Punto GP and the display is always flashing the time. I've looked through the handbook on how to change it but nothing seems to work. I've also changed the battery as that was due but that didn't do anything either.

My mileage and temp only briefly come up when I turn my car on but then soon disappear leaving the flashing time. 

Can someone please give me a suggestion on what to do as its now driving me crazy and I'm also aware that this display should bring up any error's in the vehicle if there is one. So that's another function I don't have access to.

Unfortunately shortly after getting into my Grande 2009 at the weekend, my electric window made a horrible noise just before it decided to go straight down and get stuck.  

I've now taken the inside door panel off to see the metal wire has tangled so bad around what seems to be a motor that it looks like a birds nest (hence the horrible noise). 

It seems as though the whole unit is held in by 3 bolts. Am I correct in thinking, if I buy a new/second hand electric window regulator that its an easy repair on my own? 

It seems as though id just have to unbolt the old one and slide it out of the biggest gap in the door and then slide the new unit in its place and screw the bolts... I'm really hoping its this easy as I can grab another unit for £40/80 and I can imagine it would be a lot more if I took the car to a garage.

3040,Potential Fiat owner needing guidance,shortchica,"After well over a decade of pining for a MINI, I thought this year would be my shining moment to finally own one. As it turns out, I’m not quite there yet financially. I can scrape by with the purchase price, but I’d be stuck with a 5 year old car with 50-60k miles on it. That coupled with the expensive frequent repairs I have read so much about means I likely would not be able to take care of my dream Cooper in a manner it truly needs. Bummer. Long story short, my old lady PT Cruiser is on her dying breath and I need some fun in my life. I’ve been fond of the Fiat 500 but never really considered them until recently because I had tunnel vision for MINIs. Now that I’ve poked around a bit and discovered I can actually afford a newer used one with half the mileage and the fact that they are constantly compared to Coopers, my excitement has grown quite a lot… but I keep looking for the catch. 

I’ve seen a few comments about the tires wearing quickly and some rattling noises, but that's pretty much it. When it’s time for regular maintenance, how expensive does it tend to run? I assumed being foreign cars that they’d be expensive to repair and that they’d be in and out of the shop like the MINIs are. How often do you find yourself taking your 500 in for repairs? I see the common issues in the sidebar but am curious to see how often those problems actually come up.

My commute is relatively short and mostly freeway, but I’m wondering about the tiny size of the car and what kind of power it has. How is the pickup? Both the freeway onramps near my work and home are relatively short, and half of my drive home is uphill (2-3% grade) with the last mile or so being a pretty steep 6%. It’s hell trying to get up to speed in my PT to say the least. I know Fiats aren’t powerhouses by any means, but I’d really rather avoid getting a gas-guzzling V6 just to get reasonable pickup. How do they handle getting up to speed? Any struggles?

My last question is on trim. I’ve ruled out the electric completely due to my area not being very EV friendly. The majority of the cars in my budget (trying to stay under $12k) are the Pop and the Sport, with the occasional Abarth. I can’t seem to pinpoint much of a difference between the Pop and Sport other than some cosmetic upgrades in the Sport. Obviously the Abarth is a bit set apart, but is it worth the extra cost? The closest Turbo to me is 500 miles away, so that’s just not happening.

Thanks so much in advance! I am test driving my first Fiat this weekend and can’t wait to get behind the wheel of one of these babies. Aside from my questions, I'd really love to know if there is anything specific I should be looking for or staying away from.

3041,Questions about the 500 Turbo.,Woasha,"Hey all. 

I couldn't find much about this in the threads, but my search-fu is pretty terrible in general so apologies in advance. 

I see that the engine in the Turbo is the same as the Abarth except it's electronically limited to 135hp. 

My questions are:

* 1) Is there an ECU flash or anything to kill that to ""unlock"" the Abarth engine capabilities?
* 2) Besides the limiter, what are the main mechanical differences between the Turbo and the Abarth? All I recall is the Abarth's manual transmission is ""heavy duty"" or fortified or some other janky buzzword. 
* 3) If #1 exists, does it somehow have the same mean-as-hell snarl the Abarth is famous for? Or does it sound much more subdued? 

I'd love to obliterate a 2400lb car with 160hp with near-instant available torque around town. Especially at the cheaper price point of the turbo vs the abarth. (However, I just noticed they updated the color range of the Abarth and omg that Light Blue is amazingly cute)

3061,PSA: How to replace the transmission-end bushing of your Fiat 500 (automatic) shifter cable.,swolesister,"I saved myself hundreds in towing, parts and labor with this DIY fix, so i thought it was worth sharing somewhere.

If you have an automatic Fiat 500, then you will likely encounter a day where you try to shift your car into gear, only to find that while the shifter moves, the transmission has not recieved the memo and stays in whatever gear you were in when it failed (usually park). Your dealer will tell you they have to replace the entire shifter cable assembly for 160 USD plus labor. However, before you fork over the cash, take a look under your hood (please put the ebrake on first) and look to see if the little plastic piece that connects the cable to the transmission has deteriorated or disappeared.  It is located [underneath your battery](http://i.imgur.com/va5nbgb.jpg) and will [look like this](http://i.imgur.com/tnQZwOe.jpg). It is easiest to see when the transmission and shifter are in Park, but if your transmission is stuck in Drive, just use the manual override to put the shifter in Park and see if the cable is attached to anything.

This little plastic piece can be purchased aftermarket here for less than 30 USD: http://www.bushingfix.com/fiat-500-shift-cable-bushing-replacement-kit/

The directions to fixing it can be found here: http://www.bushingfix.com/tb1kit/

If you have large hands, I recommend finding someone with small hands to reach in and replace the bushing because, as with everything under the hood of a Fiat 500, space is tight. 

Hope this helps someone else.

Edit: if you have this problem, but the bushing appears to be in place, you might have a similar problem within the shifter console. A mechanic can diagnose the issue. ",2,8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/538u6b/psa_how_to_replace_the_transmissionend_bushing_of/,1474142060,538u6b

2 weeks ago-ish, her phone stopped working via USB for audio playback. Thought it was the USB port, so I got to work. Reset the ECU, pulled fuses 5&amp;10, different cables, nothing. Scheduled a service visit.

Then, we plugged in my son's iPod Touch when lo and behold, it starts playing music! So I go back to work, and realize that only devices running iOS 9.3.3 or earlier will connect. Anything on 9.3.5 or 10 won't. So, I go to Blueandme.net to look for firmware upgrades.

Nothing. I look for support options, equally devoid of information/options. At this point I reach out to FiatUSA with my findings. Their response? ""Downgrade iOS or wait and hope for a firmware upgrade.""

I explain that going backward in iOS isn't possible, and with the 7 releasing, this is going to be a bigger problem. If this is as common as I suspect, consumers choice will be to charge phone or listen to music, but not both.

* How expensive are the yearly maintenance/repair costs ?

* How feasible is buying one, driving it for a few months, crossing fingers that nothing expensive breaks and then selling it again to fulfill the childhood dream of having owned one ?

Anyway, I would have driven off the lot today if there wasn't an issue with verifying my address. (Will probably be fixed tomorrow.)

So I've spent my night just looking and researching. The car is a 2012 500 pop with 50k miles. I've seen people say they last awhile and I've seen people say to watch out. I took it for as test drive, it seemed okay but I don't really know either way.

The dealership is Carmax and from my searching they seem to charge a lot: 9,500 for a car worth about 2k less than that. I just want to know what you guys think. I wanted something small, a little fun and won't die on me right away. My commute to work is about 2.5 miles. (I currently use Uber.)

Carmax also offers a full warranty up to 100k miles for $80 a month, something worth considering. 

So if he calls me tomorrow morning and tells me to come in, should I pull the trigger? I really hate having buyers remorse.

I've recently been looking into the purchase of a Fiat 124, and one of the interesting things I've heard from my visits to the dealership is the existence of a lifetime warranty. Since the spider is the first of its generation and Fiat has an admittedly bad, albeit dated reputation, I was wondering if this would be a wise thing to think about, especially since my family and I like to drive our cars into the ground (case in point, my current car a 2005 Honda Pilot with 275,000 miles on it). 

I don't plan to mod the car, so I was wondering that in the chance I do purchase the warranty, what particular things should I check for in regards to coverage? Personal anecdotes would be nice in regards to being in favor or against the warranty.

3099,Should I buy a Fiat 124 Spider over a more reputable Mazda?,IWannaMeetDreyfuss,"Hi guys,

Was thinking about purchasing either a GT ND Miata or a Fiat 124 Lusso for my daily/only car for commuting about 30 miles per day to school. My family is relatively well off, and have a weird stigma against buying used cars. My parents are aiming to buy me a car that will last me throughout my college, and hopefully medical school/residency (where the well off comes from), and I truly am torn between these two beautiful machines.

Of the two, I personally love the Fiat just a tad bit more than the Miata since it draws a weird visceral feeling of excitement that the Miata does not offer. I think it would be the more practical choice since the ride is a bit more refined, quieter, and a nice experience on the daily drive. It also has a little more cargo space in the trunk for random extra bits.

However, I feel as if the Fiat is a riskier investment than the Mazda, and since my parents like to buy cars for me and my siblings that last for 200,000 miles, I don't know if Fiat is the financial decision I should make; especially since the money is not my own. 

In actuality I would be extremely happy in both cars, I just find the Fiat to be more appealing. I think I am just looking for others to justify my (almost) financial decisions so I don't regret it.

Sorry for the stupid rambling, thank you!

Two, it is the classica in automatic which by no means brings thoughts of the classic sitting in the driveway right now. Three, they're all up priced from MSRP by a huge amount. It's like Fiat said, ""hey, know what these people need ~~Manuals~~ Automatics with a stupid amount of options. I just want a Lusso with none. Fits my budget and tickles me that is has leather (which no original 124 came with cloth) manual transmission (because the couple years they had auto on the originals were stupidly hard to sell), and the silver window trim, as close to the chrome as the original. (might be a slight 124 purist, idk)

my local 124 is a Classica in red priced at 28k with a 5000 dollar upcharge because Fiat only sent a handleful. Definitely not the greatest launch plan from Italy. So, like the other 8 people who have looked at that red classica and gone ""automatic? Nope, not for me"" I'm waiting on the big boat shipping in a literal boatload of cars hoping somewhere in that mess of cars is a Lusso with no extras added on with my name on it.  For now?

The car abruptly stopped when she down shifted from 5th to 4th to pass a car, the timing belt snapped causing a lot of damage to the internals of the engine.

 i originally thought it was a transmition issue but once i took it to the dealership the told me what actually happened. Fiat will not repair since the warranty expired 2 months ago. So im in talks with the dealership that sold it to me to see what their going to do but im  not expecting much since the lemon law only applies to new cars and they have been preety animate about the whole ""sold as is"" thing. i haven't even made my first payment yet... im so frustrated. i cant even find a used engine in Oklahoma. Thats my story sorry for the typos and bad grammar English is my second language.

Update:
so the dealership that sold it to me, that wishes to remain un-named  (Jackie cooper BMW of Edmond Oklahoma) did not call me today like i was told they were. So i drove up their to get some free coffee and donuts. the GM came and said well the only thing we can do is give you a discount on the engine replacement, i had to laugh because if i didnt i would have just gotten more upset. so i said theirs no way you can tell me that you guys, a ""high end"" dealership do not have some sort of protection from this worse case scenario. you have to have some way of writing off this loss that i do not.

i told them to shove the repair up their ass and that i will replace the engine myself and take them to small clams court for damages, cost of repair and towing. i did find a engine in Dallas for 500$ so ill see about getting that.",9,11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/4wen31/2012_fiat_rip/,1470462341,4wen31

I am planning to buy a used 2012 Fiat Abarth that has about 42k miles on it, from an official Fiat dealer. This has all the features on it and I really loved the test drive. 

Concerns: 

1) Is 40k miles too much for a car with manual transmission? At what point does the car start running into problems?

2) This has had 4 owners on the carfax (But 2 of those are dealers who held it for less than 2 months)

3) Car is out of warranty. How can I cover my ass from running into issues in the near future? Don't want to keep spending on mechanics after the purchase. 

I plan to drive it for a couple of years only, not for daily commute just a pleasure ride. Falls within my budget of $12k so I am eager to move forward and join the Abarth community.

2015 FIAT 500 Pop Hatchback
1.4L I-4 Cyl
Automatic
FRONT-WHEEL DRIVE
34,151 Miles
101hp @ 6,500RPM

- Is Premium gas necessary? I've heard you get better gas milage with it so the price difference is moot. Can you switch to Regular?
- Is towing a possibility? How much could you tow without loss of power?
- I've read 0-60 in less than 30 seconds, do you find this true, especially after more miles are on it?
- How is it on road trips and highway driving? 
- Do you notice too much weight negatively affects it?
- Is snow really bad? I've read it both ways. I'm a good, capable drive in poor weather and I've had small FWD cars before.

EDIT: Thanks guys! New question: What's the difference between the POP and The SPORT?

They would also take the Bug as a trade in. Is this a good deal or should we pass? Almost sounds too good to be true.

We also have to factor in insurance going up from $41/month to almost $100/month.

Are they auto aiming or auto adjusting? I've noticed that they do seem to be aimed higher than any other car I've owned. I can definitely see their effect on reflective street signs a lot further away. When I come to a stop behind another car I swear at times they seem to either dim or maybe change their aim downward.

Today before heading out to work, it was bright out and I got a good look at the pedal arrangement. The gas pedal is placed farther inward than the brake. Even with the brake fully depressed, the gas is still a bit in which seems less than ideal.

Its big, and I barely touch the peddle and thing jumps.

Ive been looking at getting something fun, economical, and maybe with a bit lower insurance (you would be surprised). I lived overseas most of my life, in Europe and Singapore, so Ive driven and seen my fair share of great cars.

What are your overall impressions? Im thinking of getting a 12' or 13' model.

I live in illinois but like to travel around alot, how is it on long drives, and does it handle snow and ice ok?

I had an 07 GTI before and loved it, only reason I dont have it now is because I moved back overseas.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HXSNYQN

I've narrowed it down to just the 500L this time, because there are significant differences between the 500 and 500L. I believe that the improvements I have decided to make would be preferable, but I'm not sure without feedback. 

They are simple improvements:

&gt;More Torque

&gt;More Horsepower

&gt;Hill-start activation on lower grade hills.

&gt;Anti-lag Turbocharger so that acceleration has less lag. 

&gt;32 GB capacity USB input, so that music can be played on more drives and hopefully it is faster.


These would probably be pretty hard to implement into the vehicle because of how tightly packed it already is, but this is just theoretical. 

I'd also be happy to take any criticisms on my survey, because there were a significant amount before. 

Lastly, this is the last survey I'll be posting, and I know it clogs this sub which is definitely not for taking surveys on FIAT cars, it's for talking about FIAT vehicles.

3317,Does gas mileage display on the dashboard?,WaryBradshaw,"This might be a common sense question, but I have looked through all the dashboard menu items and can't find an option to display how much gas mileage my car is actually getting. I have a 2013 Fiat 500 Sport in the US which is new to me. I used to have a Chevy Cobalt that would display what my mpg was if I clicked the menu button enough times. I'm aware there is an option to view it via flash drive but that seems a bit tedious, I only really think about it when I'm in the car. If it doesn't display like that, I think I'll get over it =)

3318,Any ideas?,bubba_OBLIVION,"I've been having some issues with my car (alternator/battery), took it into service and was told I needed a new battery because mine was only holding a 50% charge- it was under warranty so I got a new one from auto zone (3rd one in less than a year now). Then they ran some more tests, only to come back with ""can't do anything if it doesn't pull any codes and it's not pulling any."" It took them over a week to come to this conclusion for some reason. 

Since then I've been having issues with starting, it's slow to catch or it just doesn't until I try again- not all the time but 1/3 of the tune it will have issues starting up normally. 
And then today's issue- the big one- driving down the highway my engine turned off completely. The battery light and the oil light came on but the car had no power. I was able to pull over, turn the car off for real, and restart it. But it scared me as I live in a big city, there's a huge festival happening and traffic is horrible as it is, and I could have been in an accident because of this. 


I've already taken a week off work so they would look at my vehicle, and it's looking like I'm going to take another one so they can look it over again. Just wondering if anyone out there has had similar problems/can provide any insight or ideas at all as to what would have caused today's problem. Or any tips on how to handle the service department because I'm seriously losing my patience at this point.",9,6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/4akjtg/any_ideas/,1458077119,4akjtg

I'm looking into what to replace my 2008 Honda Fit with in the next year or so. Living in New England, I'd ideally like something that has AWD to maybe handle a little better in the snow, but also something that isn't huge since I live in a city, and I'd primarily be using it as a commuter car. Also hoping to retain the hatchback style for a little added utility in a pinch.

So far I've narrowed the field down to the 500X Trekking, the Honda HR-V, and the Subaru Crosstrek. They all look like they'd meet my criteria. I've owned a Honda and a Subaru in the past, so I feel like I know what I'm getting in both those cases, but Fiat is a pretty new brand in this area, so I'm curious to solicit feedback on how current owners are enjoying theirs.",9,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/4456fe/any_fiat_500x_owners_out_there_willing_to_share/,1454591418,4456fe

3445,New Fiat - I think I have an issue.,Bavvh,"I live near Louisville. I bought a 2015 500 a couple of weeks ago from a local Chrysler dealer. The day AFTER I bought it, the local (very large) Fiat dealer suddenly closed up shop. Here it is two weeks later, and for the last three mornings, I've gone out to the car at 6am and had a dead instrument cluster. If I walk away from the car for a while, and go back, it will work. But I don't have time to wait around in the morning for my car to get it's shit together, yanno? 


I called the dealership this morning, and they said that the repair would be covered under my warranty, but they can't do it. The closest dealership is a couple of hours away.


This leads to my questions..
Can only DEALERSHIPS do warranty work? We have a good import garage here, but I don't know that warranty repairs would be able to be done by a non dealership. (I'm more than irritated that they sold me a car that they couldn't work on, BTW. This was my first dealership car, and I didn't know any better. Now I do.)


Next question is has anyone had a similar problem? My google-fu failed me. It's hard driving to work with no instruments. At least the speedometer is mechanical..

Update: It's absolutely cold related. Every morning that the temperature has dipped close to freezing, I have no cluster. I called the closest dealership to us, and we'll have to make an appointment to drive out there and just take a day off work. :(",15,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/3zvsdk/new_fiat_i_think_i_have_an_issue/,1452178540,3zvsdk

3460,"I can't start my car, what do I do?",branbb60,"Hello everyone, 

I have recently bought a Fiat Seicento three nights ago I attempted to start my car and it didn't do anything, not even a partial noise. I assumed a simple fix of changing the battery and it didn't do anything either, still the same problem. 

When I try to start the car and I let go of the Key there is a ticking noise from the black box at the top right of the car under the hood (which I think are the fuses which have been checked and everything is fine).

On the dashboard the ""Key Code"" light is on as well as the warning light. I have read the manual and attempted to do the emergency start up and it does not work as the warning light will go out and not come back on even without me touching the accelerator leaving the ""KeyCode"" light on. http://i.imgur.com/NL4zq2f.jpg?2

This is my first car and it was bought five days ago, recently serviced and it came back with nothing needed as well as no advisories. 

In all honesty i'm bad with cars so small words are appreciated.

3463,2014 Fiat 500L big problems (Serious),ignored_rice,"Hi guys.  I just don't know what to do.  I bought my Fiat 500L (2014) last January- brand new with 27 miles on the odometer.
Around July, my mother noticed a moldy smell inside the car.  I myself couldn't pick it up.  It got to the point that my mother couldn't ride in the car because the smell was overwhelming (by September).  
In October, I started smelling it (also started getting headaches for no apparent reason - especially when in the car, and my asthma started to give me problems).  I finally took the car to the dealership on October 9th, 2015.  Service adviser and Service Manager confirmed the mold smell.  Didn't hear from the dealership, so I called on the 12th to see what was up.  Service advisor said that they indeed found the problem - a hose that was supposed to drain condensation from the ac to outside of the car was not connected properly and was draining into the floor of the car.  They told me the problem was fixed - drain hose had been connected, and I could pick up the car.  Yay, right?! NO.  The mold was still in the car.  I told them I would not take the car home until this was taken care of.  I called their service on the mainland (I live in Hawai'i) and was told that they would have to send out the car to a third party to have the mold removed and I could submit the bill for POSSIBLE reimbursement.  During the mean time, I was told by this company person that I should just put an air freshener in my car and drive with the windows down.  I flat-out refused.  I paid for a brand new car, and NEVER expected this type of problem from a NEW car.  
I walked away from the dealership and told them to do what needed to be done to fix the mold, but I would not pay for it with only the possibility of being reimbursed.
I reached out to FIAT USA on their Facebook page and told them of my extreme disappointment in their car.  
Within a day, Emily from FIAT contacted me and told me that they would replace the carpet and padding in the car - and pay for a rental car during this time.
My car was in the shop for 2 months because of the dealership's  bumbling errors in ordering parts and only replacing the carpet the first time - then realizing they should've replaced the padding too (I picked it up on Dec.7th, 2015).  There was a lot of back and forth with the dealership and Emily during this time (I kept my calm throughout this whole mess).
My car smelled brand new for the first week, and now the mold smell is back.  Now I question if the work was done at all?  I know if I bring it in for another servicing, they will be vindictive, as I did not give their dealership a great review on Yelp, and - as I was told by their Service Manager, I had ""escalated my complaint to social media.""  There are a few things that I am noticing about my car that were not problems before...
Don't get me wrong.  I love my car, but I cannot keep going through this.  
What do you think my next steps should be?  I am just an elementary school teacher who wanted a new car (my first).
I have friends saying to consult a lawyer.  Has anyone gone through this hell?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  
TL/DR:  My Fiat is moldy, and it's not my fault.

3466,Seeking Advice on 2012 Fiat 500 With Some Problems,carefulcactus,"Hello, I just found this subreddit and was looking for advice on my 2012 Gucci Fiat 500.  I love my car, and I have had it since May 2014.  There are 45,000 miles on the car so it is still under warranty.  I really don't know much about cars and fixing them, so I was hoping for some advice from some of you here.

Last month, I started having issues with the transmission.  The car  actually broke down in the middle of the highway while I was driving it and the wheels locked so no one could push it off the highway.  I got it towed to the dealership and they told me it was the transmission, which is what I was expecting.  But I do find it odd that the transmission went after 45,000 miles.  Since it is under warranty still, I got a new transmission and it drove like new for 6 days.

On the 6th day that I had it back, I was going to leaving work, and my engine would not start.  The car would start, but the engine would not.  The car was driving completely fine that morning on my way into work, and then it sat in the parking lot for about 9 hours before I tried to drive it again.  I got it towed (again) to the dealership, and they told me it was the starter.  The starter was replaced, and it still wouldn't work.  After checking the battery, it was showing very low voltage.  So, they replace the battery, and it still won't work.

After running diagnostics, the dealership told me that the car is reading that it is stuck in 2nd gear, but they cannot figure out WHY it is saying that it is stuck in 2nd gear. They have been working on it for 3 days and still can't figure it out. They tell me it could be an issue with the computer but they don't know what is causing it.

So I guess my questions are -

1. Does what the dealership is saying make sense? They seem adamant that it isn't the transmission that was just replaced, but I feel like it should at least be considered.  Again, I don't know much about cars, and maybe they did consider it and rule it out.

2. Is it worth it? Once I get the car back, does it make sense to just sell it and go for something else? I haven't put any money in it yet, because this has been all warranty work, but I need a reliable car, and if this is going to keep happening then I don't want to start putting money into a car that is constantly breaking down after only a year and a half-ish.

3. Has any other Fiat driver experienced anything like this before?


Thanks for your help in advance! I really do love my Fiat, and I would hate to get rid of it! But I also haven't had it in a month basically since it's been in the shop, and I am tired of living out of a rental car.

3515,What makes the Abarth sound so good?,EllenPaosPenis,"I love the 500 Abarth for its exhaust noise, but also love the 500 pop for its price (Found a manual 2012 pop with 31k km's for $9,000). I found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJwa9NJRDAk) which shows a pop with Abarth exhaust and it sounds so good. 

Since all I can afford is a pop, or rather my parents won't spend much money on a Fiat (A Nissan sure, but they don't want me to go anywhere near a fiat lol), I will have to do the exhaust work on my own. To make the Pop sound like an Abarth is it something as simple as removing the muffler or is there more to it? I ask because that video description says ""Fiat 500 Pop with Abarth Exhaust"" so presumably there is something special with the exhaust.

I would also like to add I always thought the Fiat 500 was a girls car. I didn't think it looked good, thought it was dangerously small. I was at the Kia dealership picking up my grandparents Sportage for them (Just maintenance, its a great car) and heard this car starting from a few feet away that just sounded *so good*. It was so loud my dads only comment, while watching me be absorbed by this car, was ""There is something wrong with that car!"" That was when my mind changed about Fiats. Not 6 months before I saw an Abarth and thought ""Why the hell would anyone in their right mind buy a performance fiat 500?"" I was so wrong and completely understand why. 

Anyways, I hope to join you guys soon. I am used to driving a Crown Victoria, which I absolutely adore, so parking and driving a tiny car like a 500 in downtown should be a breeze. Driving around in a car that will throw you backwards into your seat if you hit the gas too hard, I have learned responsible driving habits that are safe and save fuel so I am hoping I can get 30+ mpg around town. I have a light foot and with it being a manual I think that is completely reasonable.

I just realized I wrote a bunch of crap that hardly has anything to do with the post so back to my question: What makes the Abarth sound so good? Apart from it being turbo'd of course. I know that adds a nice whistling sound when it accelerates. ",10,4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/3suzbe/what_makes_the_abarth_sound_so_good/,1447559797,3suzbe

As to maintenance….. oil changes at 8k, got speedometer bundle and armrest replaced under warranty.

Some of the interior body parts are poor; clutch boot broke, dash illumination on and off. It has a fault where the oil pressure light comes on when engine is warm and in neutral or going around corners. pretty sure oil pressure is fine. Dealer said engine has to be basically rebuilt to fix this known fault. This fault has been going on intermittently for a long time. Turns out, oil quality affects. Happens less with good quality 5-40 synthetic oil( a little more viscous than the 5-30 Fiat recommends. Local dealer, capitol in San Jose was helpful with advice for this.

Have a 2014 500 Lounge w/ manual. It stinks godawful inside, and the carpets are moldy and drenched. I'm unsure if it's condensation from the air conditioner, or rainwater from outside. (Been both hot and rainy all summer.)

I've noticed that the car drains a significant amount of fluid onto the ground whenever I park, right behind the front passenger wheel. I suspect that this is some sort of condensation drain, and coincidentally, the front passenger carpet is the worst. (Though the back and driver sides are affected as well.)

I can dry them out, but they are always soaked later the same day.

The OEM tires are $108 on [tirerack.com](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Continental&amp;tireModel=ContiProContact&amp;partnum=945HR6CPCXL&amp;i1_Qty=4&amp;autoMake=Fiat&amp;autoModel=500&amp;autoYear=2013&amp;autoModClar=Sport&amp;vehicleSearch=true) or $500 for a full set (including delivery, but not installation) but most tire shops charge around $150-170 to order the tires plus installation. All told estimates for replacing a full set of tires  ran about $650-$840. My highest estimate was $834.39

 However, I've read that the OEM tires have poor to middling reviews on various sites. [Michelin](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Michelin&amp;tireModel=Pilot+Sport+A%2FS+3+%28H-+or+V-Speed+Rated%29&amp;partnum=945VR6PSAS3&amp;vehicleSearch=true&amp;fromCompare1=yes&amp;autoMake=Fiat&amp;autoYear=2013&amp;autoModel=500&amp;autoModClar=Sport) made a tire in this size that was much more highly rated, but apparently is no longer in production. The only other all season option left is the [Pirelli Cinturato](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Pirelli&amp;tireModel=Cinturato+P7+All+Season&amp;partnum=945VR6CP7ASXL&amp;vehicleSearch=true&amp;fromCompare1=yes&amp;autoMake=Fiat&amp;autoYear=2013&amp;autoModel=500&amp;autoModClar=Sport) which sell for $150 each on tirerack ($660 for a full set)

 I've yet to get an estimate from a studio as their service departments are closed Sundays. Hopefully this information will help any one looking to replace their tires. 

EDIT: Ordered slightly larger tires, saved a ton of money and got MUCH better tires than the standard tires. The [Bridgestone Potenza](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Bridgestone&amp;tireModel=Potenza+RE760+Sport&amp;sidewall=Blackwall&amp;partnum=045WR6RE760&amp;tab=Sizes) out scores the standard Continental tires in everything except winter conditions, which I am unlikely to encounter in South Florida.  I'm not the type to take a risk with out knowing as much as possible about it first. In my research I learned the standard aluminum alloy rim is 16x6.5 inches. I also checked various  [online tire size comparison calculators](http://www.1010tires.com/Tools/Tire-Size-Calculator/195-45R16/205-45R16) this shows that the difference between the standard tire and the slightly larger tire is negligible, and that the tire should fit on the rim no problem. Using a different size tire opens up many more options both in terms of price and performance, so you can choose the tire that more suits your driving style and conditions. 

Will update on the tires performance after installation and test driving 

FINAL EDIT: Had the new tires installed today and the car drives better than new! I swear the car has less road noise now than it did coming off the lot!

There are some ripoff versions that are lower quality when recording. There are some sites that will show you how to make sure you have an authentic model. This is what I have and for the price it's a no brainier. It's just too bad you don't get an insurance discount in the U.S. For using a dash cam.

Anyway super easy to install. I run the cable up between the headliner and windshield tucked away and then tucked into the weatherstrip along the A-pillar and down under the leg area to the power adapter in the center console (2014 model).

I think it comes with a little tool to help stuff the cable in the headliner, but I'm not sure, I might have used a tire lever from my bicycle.

It starts up automatically and shuts off on auto too. So you set it up once and forget it. There are more advanced models by black box of you want them. Otherwise just get a nice big memory card and there you go. Highly recommended and very affordable.

I am wondering if anyone has any input on pros and cons for Turbo vs Abarth?

Main concerns are: 

1# Will the Abarth help or hurt resale value over Turbo?

2# are repair parts costs significantly different on the two or basically the same minus engine tuning and suspension?

3# is the drive and feel that much different?

It was as if I was looking for a needle on a haystack. Under $18,000 and less than 20,000 miles and newer than 2013. Online I found a 2013 Fiat for $15,000 and it only had 18,000 miles on it. I thought that I would never be caught dead in a car that small but had no luck finding anything else so I decided to check it out at the dealership anyway. 

When I got there the dealer said they had sold that particular one that morning but they had a 2015 Abarth that is being sold as pre-owned due to a manufacturer issue. The roof had fissures so they welded them shut and repainted it. This effectively took around $8,000 off the sticker price so actually I ended up finding a car for $18,000 and only 200 miles on it. I test drove it and was shocked by how it performed and with how roomy it seems inside and as a single man with no kids it's all I need. 

A little while later I left my first car at a dealership and drove home in a brand new 2015 Fiat 500 Abarth.

2. When the brake pedal is pressed
3. When the rear fog-lights are turned on
4. When the car is in PARK mode

Instead id get it running and road safe/legal, and then slowly swap out whatever id cobbled together to, say, get a seat mounted, with original or replica parts. It will be a rolling restoration, but will not be modded in any way that isn't for comfort (new seats, matching style though) or safety (seat belts of some form as well as new electrical system for headlights and brake lights)

I've owned the Fiat since 4/21/14. It's been doing the problem you see in the video for the last 8 or so months. It usually happens everyone I try and start the car, especially in the last few weeks. Other times it'll go weeks without giving me an issue.
Since its under warranty I've had it at the dealer a total of 5 times for this problem. After they replaced the starter, solenoid, ignition, and finally the whole engine wiring harness, they STILL have no idea what's wrong. Since they can't replicate often they also have a hard time pinpointing the problem. I am desperate and need help, I don't know what else to do.
As a side note you can hear the speakers crackle when you turn the key sometimes, especially when it doesn't start. I can hear a ""CLICK"" from the starter but it doesn't actually engage. Then when it decides to want to work the starter engages when you turn the key no problem.

The radio has the white Mp3 logo above the CD tray and a Blaupunkt logo below (Again, see picture!).


So I've seen a few comments saying that on non-Blue &amp; Me models, you need to buy an AUX cable online and get it fit to the back of the radio. 


Can you guys here at r/Fiat confirm this for me? Also, do I need a specific cable, as there seem to be a few different ones showing up when I search eBay for 'Grande Punto AUX'?

Here is the sequence of events. Place car in reverse. Begin reversing. Hear RC car noise that every manual trans car makes. Coming to end of drive way, off gas onto clutch. As the car coasts backwards with no throttle and the clutch disengaged I can hear a ticking/popping noise coming from the bottom of the car. If I were to apply more gas and reverse under power again the noise will disappear. The car does no such thing if I'm going forwards with the car in gear but the clutch disengaged. I was going to schedule a service for the third week of April when I take a week of PTO. Anybody familiar with this? Can the issue wait till the car is in service or should I take it in much sooner than that. Have only had the car for coming up on three thousand miles. I'm not really bummed. Shit happens and this is what warranties are for. I just don't want to get stuck somewhere with either no reverse (seems unlikely) or driveline damage (seems a little more likely). 

UPDATE: The studio thinks it's a clutch. After speaking with a Fiat support case manager at the behest of the studio service manager Fiat has agreed to bend the rules and cover the clutch even though it's technically no longer under warranty. I'm really glad that both the dealer and Fiat were willing to go the extra mile and if they do VOC calls I'll be happy to give both gentleman top scores. My courtesy car is a manual trans 500L.

Does anyone here have any experience with Grande Puntos? Are there any common faults at certain mileages etc etc? Would the Grande Punto be a decent but as a first car?


Or, do you have any other advice for me in general?

So, I don't know a whole lot about fiats. I have driven 4 used fiats so far. All were 2012-2013. 2 were sports, 2 were pops. The sports seemed to be better quality (nice seats, sound system, better interior, etc.). They just felt better made while the pops felt cheap and plasticy. However, I am not sure if all sports are seemingly better quality or if the two owners who had the sports just had upgrades (both had heated seats and Bose sound systems, which were really appealing). 

Is this the standard? What are the most quality feelings models? What are the differences? It's hard to tell by looking online.

I am planning on going to a Fiat dealership tomorrow, but I was just wondering what you all think.

Thought it might be some stray plastic got on something hot -- but started it this morning to maneuver for a tow, and the smoke starts up the second I turn the engine on.

3890,"2012 500c Pop Clutch Replacement at 22,000 miles",maxhatcher,"I've been a lurker for a while but thought this was worth posting for any potential new owners.

Anyways, I just got my 2012 500c manual transmission back from the shop last Friday - $1,772.45, not including car rental, tow charge or gas for rental. Basically, 2K all in. 

The culprit was the pressure plate. The clutch disc, release bearing, etc. were all in great condition, although I opted to replace these. Like many others, once this fails it causes the Clutch Slave Cylinder to blow so you really have to replace everything. One of the output shaft seals was leaking (not really related to clutch problem) so we replaced it as well. All in all this is totally messed up for so few miles on this car.

Millage was 22,800 when it blew. This is a daily local driver. I haven't even needed to have the original brake pads changed yet! I got the run around with the dealer that they'd need to run some ""tests"" and manual trans. only have a 1 year / 12,000 warranty so I had it taken to my local mechanic. Fiat Roadside assistance charged me $100 since I wouldn't be taking it to the closest dealer 18 miles away, but to my local shop 1.4 miles away. They also didn't use the local towing company that whose fleet you see roaming around. After many failed attempts and two days later this other tow truck guy finally shows up. Needless to say I was shadowing him the whole time and followed him to the shop, even as close as it was. 

My mechanic's opinion is the transmission is under built and he showed me what a similar sized car's transmission parts looked like. I forgot what model it was from but the release bearing was twice the size and the pressure plate was massive compared to the Fiats.

Other than a few rattling parts (driver's window and steering column cover) this has been the only major service I've had to do on the car, but come on, I can't believe Fiat thinks replacing the clutch ever 22,000 miles is acceptable. In hindsight I should of seen about sourcing some aftermarket clutch parts.

Size is not an issue. I'm a small person with no kids. Our other vehicle is a Ram 2500 mega-cab long-bed ranch truck, so we're good on space and utility when we need it. 

My biggest concern is that the huge price difference between the new and used models reflects a reliability issue at higher mileage. I've noticed the 2013 fiat 500s in particular are *extremely* cheap. Why the massive drop in sticker price? Reliability-related, or something else I'm missing?

3952,Test drove a 500L today and have a few ?'s,s4ltydog,"The wife and I test drove a few vehicles today. A Dodge Charger RT, a Durango and the 500L. I loved the Charger, she loved the Durango.... But we both loved the Fiat. We have two young children and we definitely need a new vehicle but for our budget we can buy a used something else or a new Fiat. I love the absolute chasm that is the interior. I'm 6'5 290 lbs and fit beautifully while still leaving plenty of space in the back for kids. Yet it also gets great fuel economy (especially compared to the 1990 Range Rover I drive now). I even like the way it looks, I've always had a soft spot for quirky looking vehicles. So my questions; 1- I have heard about some serious reliability issues with the earlier model Fiats (2012s mostly) is that a concern any more? I mean I get that there is a warranty but I'm the type to drive something till the wheels fall off, fix it and keep driving (as you can tell by the age of my current vehicle lol) so I'm looking for something I can potentially keep like way past 100k miles. Question 2; how have your experiences been with them? I'm hoping there's some people here that have a fair bit of miles on they're vehicles that can tell me if you still like your cars even after the honeymoon is over. Thanks in advance! I'm hoping they really are all they are cracked up to be because we are very excited, and as a Redditor it would be nice to be part of this community!",10,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2ucsux/test_drove_a_500l_today_and_have_a_few_s/,1422748284,2ucsux

3957,500L Problem Today,59snomeld,"My wife was driving our 500L trekking (with the automatic transmission) to work this morning and she had to turn back home after a few miles because she ran into a problem with her car. The car wasn't able to get out of second gear and it started lurching back and forth. I tried driving it to see if it did it again. When I drove it I wasn't able to get out of second either, nor was it able to get above 5 miles an hour without doing the lurching thing. I had to turn back into our neighborhood right away. Has anyone else experienced this. Does it make any difference that we live in the Northeast and it sat through the blizzard yesterday? Also it has ~25500 miles on it

3960,Brand new 2015 Fiat 500 Pop - Have a few questions,Agentbolt,"I purchased a bone-stock 500 pop a few weeks ago, and I quite like the car. It's cheap all right, but as a city cruiser it does fine.  There's a few thing about I did have question on potentially improving though.

#1.  The sales guy at the dealership kind of, well, outright lied to me and said the color I wanted (Laser Blue) isn't available with the upgraded sound system (which I'd wanted).  Clearly that's not the truth, but now I'm curious what a good, cost-effective aftermarket upgrade might be.  Should I just do the speakers, or does the radio really need to go to? (No idea how powerful the radio is, but it seems to overwhelm the speakers pretty quickly if I have any bass at all)

#2.  Speaking of music, the 2015 model's Blue&amp;Me system seems...weird.  First, music is MUCH quieter through it than through the radio.  I've upped every volume setting I can find on my Iphone, but no dice.  I need to have the radio set at 20 for the bluetooth and only like 10 or so for the radio.  On the rare idiotic occasion I stall, for example, my radio comes back on so loud that it threatens to blow the speakers.  Is there a known issue with Bluetooth audio streaming, or is there some other weird setting I'm missing.

#3.  The biggest problem: The wife.  She has a 2010 Cooper S and says she simply doesn't feel comfortable driving my car because it's too slow.  

For casual city-driving it's fine, it comes off the line reasonably quickly and can catch up to traffic.  But admittedly, on the highway where my wife would drive it, it's a different story.  The 0-40 speed is, you know, decent, but the 40-60+ time is a lot more problematic. One a more rural 2 lane highway, she felt REALLY terrified trying to pass someone going 40 in a 50mph zone.

I know I didn't buy an Abarth or even a turbo, so I'm not expecting miracles here, but since I DO like the car, is there anything I can do to just get it a LITTLE bit more responsive?  I've seen some mentions of a product called GoPedal, and something like that (maybe a couple hundred bucks at most, that I can do myself) would be ideal if it really helps (without causing long-term issues to the car or voiding its warranty).  If the only option that would get it to go moderately more quickly is an aftermarket turbo, I'll look into that instead, but is that even something people do?  Turbocharge a stock 500?  Is that like, a $1,000 job or a $5,000 one?  

Thanks for any insight fellow Fiat owners!",18,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2tqeqw/brand_new_2015_fiat_500_pop_have_a_few_questions/,1422290008,2tqeqw
3961,It was my wife who screwed me in the end. Leave the ding or replace the front fender?,[deleted],I bought my 500 11 months ago. I know people are careless so I always park far away from everyone in parking lots. So far so good. Until today. She dinged it right in our driveway. It's tiny and no paint was lost. But it bothers the crap out of me because I know it's there. Now I'm tempted to get someone to just replace the front fender entirely. The part itself is only 50 bucks but labor for painting and replacement would probably take that closer to 200. It's alot and wouldn't happen had she been more careful. But she wasn't and either I pay to have it fixed or just live with it and the suffering it is causing me. What would you do?

3963,From Miata to Fiat,IntoTheMirror,"My '95 NA became too much of a sacrifice this past summer. Taking girlfriend on family vacation with me there was no way both of our luggage would fit in it. The sacrifice was in having to leave it home and take her slush box fiesta. Nothing against Fiestas, just slush boxes. The roads I used to enjoy beating on between towns and in the woods were almost soulless in that thing. I'm shopping certified used and have driven both the Abarth and the Sport. The noise the Abarth makes is out of this world. Everybody is right about that. For me personally though it has a little too much power. The slower sport felt almost preferable. There's a lot of traffic around the dealership I'm shopping with and while I felt almost as if I had to be good in the Abarth the Sport required me to really hold gears and wind out the engine just to keep up with everybody. To me, that's so much fun! The first generation Miata is a car you can drive WOT without getting in much trouble and it seems like WOT is SOP for the Sport as well. Granted a test drive only ever gives you a first impression and first impressions don't always turn out to be correct. I think I'm already sold on buying a 500. I like the looks, features and availability of manual transmissions. When it comes down to living with it in a congested metro area and using it for commuting and brief day trip kicks how does the Sport stack up?",19,4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2tf1rx/from_miata_to_fiat/,1422031742,2tf1rx

Previously with the iPhone when using google maps for driving directions, the phone would cut the music off and ""call"" the car (it said ""connecting call..."" and ""In call..."" on the console anytime directions were announced. 

Android does not do this. The driving directions stay local on the phone's speaker instead of connecting to the car. I've tried 4 different Android phones in total (Borrowed some friends phones momentarily for testing) and none of theirs would connect for driving directions either.

3970,Music from USB stick/Smartphone FIX!,CameronHicks,"Hey Reddit,

I've been struggling with 'No source available' for a long time (since I bought my 2014 Fiat 500 actually). I've been at service center maybe 4 times. We updated firmware to 2015 as I was told at first (didn't help, but I have a feeling that it started running as 2015 as during my test drive), then we changed the USB part (helped me to find the solution).

I had OnePlus One, Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom (thank you old buddy - main reason I fixed it) and USB stick.
None of them would work ever. I had my OnePlus One playing track for maybe 15s during 3h research.

**Here's my guide for fellow FIAT drivers:**

* Plug in your device, click main Blu&amp;Me button on the steering wheel, select Media Player with buttons behind and look what it says.
* If it says ""Play anything"" you have no technical issue. If you see only ""USB settings"" and maybe Autoplay, Shuffle, then you need to fix software issue first.
* If you're getting ""No media found"" continue to read :)

**USB stick:**
Plug it into your PC, click properties and look at the format. If it's NTFS, you need to format it with FAT32 (it'll erase all the files, but will fix the recognition issue)

**Android phone:**  
1) Don't use any USB debugging options if you know what that is.  
2) Don't use Mass Storage mode with root applications if again you know what that is.  
3) Plug it into your PC first with MTP mode. Look if you have two folders inside the device or just one. For example: Camera, Internal Storage.  
4) If you have Camera, put music files there, it would work in the car via MTP.  
5) If you have only Internal Storage, then you need to choose PTP mode and look at the folders that will appear. For example: Pictures, DCIM. Remember the names of these folders. You can't put any files or create any folders in there in my case.  
6) Choose MTP mode and put your music folder inside of the folders from PTP mode. I've put mine in DCIM.  
7) Plug the phone into FIAT and choose PTP mode. :)  

* After clicking ""Play anything"" it should say right away ""Creating media library, please wait"". Wait for about 5-10s and then it should work.

*Please note:* They guy who was trying to fix it had iPhone and it worked for him after second and third visit. When I got a car from him, we tried to check with service representative's iPhone and it didn't.

If it's not reading all the tracks from the USB stick, you probably should try BluMeUSB7 windows application, but I didn't try. It should optimize your folder names.",3,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2skcza/music_from_usb_sticksmartphone_fix/,1421361642,2skcza

The nerve of some people. Anyways, I have no idea what the correct part number is, or what that part is even CALLED. I'm a bit desperate considering that wires are just out there, and in Florida it can rain at ANY moment. 

So far the only places I've found the part have been in the UK, and I'm sure there HAS to be somewhere in the states I'm not seeing.

When I started it this morning, it registered 30.7psi so I was like WTF?  I got out of the car and checked the pressures with a digital gauge and both front tires were 32.9psi (reasonable considering it was way below freezing).  I drove to work instead of going to the dealership and when I started my car after work, the warning said the pressure was now 31.9psi.

But now with the moto x (which is a great phone, dont let my difficulties put you off it) audio from the phone will only play in the car if I use the steering wheel controls.

4091,I'll show you mine if you show me yours,Vectorbug,"I just bought my first new car, a 2014 500 Turbo. Loving it so far, but then again its brand new, not just ""new to me"". As a cyclist, a new car is my worst enemy. Especially as winter is approaching. I'm going to get so fat, and I have to pay for parking at work.

I'm coming from a 1995 Mazda Miata with only 100k miles on it. I loved that car but after realizing its a 20 year old vehicle (as bulletproof as it is), I flipped my shit after less than a year and bought the 500. Before that I had a 200hp GTI, I've had other miatas, a Porsche 914, some Saabs, a Fiero and so on. I love small cars. Now that I'm married and we have a dog, a 2 seater just felt irresponsible. But I highly recommend the Miata. If you think the 500 is fun, imagine it weighing less with no top and RWD.

Anyway, /r/fiat seems pretty dead compared to /r/miata, we should fix that. I've been using other subreddits to help drive traffic to a magazine I'm helping to design. One post to a somewhat obscure subreddit and I get 500 views over night. I'd think fiat accessory shops would be into those kinds of metrics for sponsorship or coupon codes.

Anyway, lets start with some photos. It's not particularly special, but I was happy with the framing and setting of my photos. I'd like to get some lower springs but I don't want to risk the warranty.

How about yours?

But I didn't think I had let the clutch out too fast.  And then I couldn't get it started again.  No ""whirr whirr whirr whirr"" noise of the engine trying to turn over.

She's a 2012 model, only got 30km on it, pretty sure the battery is fine.  According to some googling, apparently this is a common issue - something about a starter solenoid?  

Anywho, after 30 minutes of waiting for the flatbed (tow truck company said the 500 is too small a car to be towed on a traditional tow truck), and 100 tries at the ignition later, it just started, like it was brand new.  The only thing odd about the start was that much more smoke came out of the exhaust than I'm used to seeing, and it stank.  But I managed to drive it all the way home no problem.

4109,American owners of the 500: How did you haggle for yours?,[deleted],"In my area we have 3 dealers within about 50 miles - thats it for the state. Their online inventory kind of sucks and the pricing kind of sucks compared to the next state over which is only about 200 miles.

I originally didn't want to spend more than $13k and was willing to buy a used IQ because they have a 7 year warranty for CPO. But the 500 has more soul - lukewarm warranty, however.

Anyway, the best deal I've found is a used 2013 5-spd Sport with about 20k miles for $13k from a (non fiat) dealer.

I asked one of the Fiat dealerships if they had anything comparable to this deal and they sent me a link to a New Pop. I'd really prefer a Sport.

This morning I found this Fiat dealer has a new 2014 Turbo (manual) for $16k in a color I can tolerate (white). I'm not wild about a turbo, more parts to break, but if its new it'll have a nice 5 year warranty.

Even though I live in the largest city in my state, it doesn't seem like the dealers have a huge inventory they're dying to unload. There aren't any 2013s in stock and very few 2014s so my options are limited.

**TLDR** Any advice? I've tried pitting a couple of the dealers against each other but they just played dumb. So I guess, just walk in and try to find leverage with my smartphone? I'm approved for about 3% with my bank, I know dealerships get fat kickbacks if I do financing through them, could I use that as leverage to get a lower OTD price?

Backlights when the headlights are on do not always work. I will turn the headlights on and the backlights just do not come on, but will after a few minutes (without my prompting). 

I bought the car brand new in May (well, it is a 2013, but had no previous owners as Fiats are not super popular in Texas). Will be bringing to the shop for them to take a look at it, but wanted to see if anyone else had the same problems. Only has 5000 miles on it.

4127,Does anyone have experience fitting after market hubcaps on a 500?,Cellophane_Flower,"Edited to add: 2012

So my cheap plastic hubcaps were stolen off my 500 Sport, so I thought, I might as well find something more stylish. I bought some vintage [smoothie hubcaps](http://hubcapmike.com/smoothie_hubcaps.html) and they just don't fit. They sit loose and pop off easily. I called the vendor and he immediately said ""Oh yeah the 500s have weird wheels, those won't fit. Send them back.""

I've looked around online and I see that others have the same issue and used silicone to stick them on. Well I'm not going to glue my hubcaps on, that just seems like a dumb idea. But now I feel stuck with bare wheels unless I want to buy all new wheels and I just don't have have kind of money. 

Does anyone have experience with this issue? I'd hate to spend money on those cheap hubcaps that came with the car but I don't see any other options. 

One other question: while on this search I've been seeing that Sports come with 16 inch wheels as part of their trim, but I have 15 inch.

4142,Highway Instability,badassmthrfkr,"Hey, I got a 2014  5-speed Sport late last week and took it on a highway for the first time today: It was a scary experience.  What I previously feared about the reports of the lack of freeway acceleration turned out to be a non-issue that could be solved with a downshift, but the steering and the overall control of the vehicle scared me.  Every time there was a curve while doing anything over 60, the steering felt like it would jerk the car at the slightest adjustment over to another lane.  Same with the ""raked"" parts of the highways that's supposed to keep your car in the lane, but the steering felt more dangerous.

I had the ""sports mode"" on so that might be it: I was under the impression it tightens steering, but if it just makes it more sensitive, it might be the opposite effect than what I want in the highways.  Or it might be from the fact that I'm used to driving a prelude that's really low and I'm just feeling insecure with a taller sitting position and more wind effects.  Any other ideas why?

4146,Anti-Fiat Road Agression?,snooze_sensei,"SO I hesitate to write this post... but I am wondering if anyone is experiencing what I've experienced since buying my Fiat 3 weeks ago. 

I do a LOT of driving. In 3 weeks I've put 2600 miles on my new Fiat 500 Sport. I've driven lots of cars in the past, both big and small, fast and slow. Most recent two were a 97 Mazda 626 (big compared to the Fiat), and a 96 Ford Crown Vic P71 (police) (big compared to anything except a tank). 

Since starting to drive the Fiat, though, it seems like other drivers on the road... are exhibiting a LOT more aggression than I'm accustomed to. By which I mean, I'm having people do things around me that make me think they are actively being aggressive on purpose. 

I do NOT drive slow. Yet, people are constantly trying to get AROUND me by speeding up, and THEN they slow down in front of me. This happens CONSTANTLY on the freeway. Like they THINK I'm going to drive slow even when I'm not. 

At least 5 times this week I have been forced to slam on my brakes when people are trying to pass me on the right while the right lane is ENDING (forced merge).  Because I'm going faster than they think, they usually don't have ROOM to pass me unless I slam on my brakes. 

In the WORST someone came so close to hitting me doing this (pulling around me on the right while the lane was merging) that I honked at him, and he slammed on his brakes in front of me, pulled over, and tried to force me to stop. I was able to maneuver around him and exit, so he punched it and followed me down the exit ramp. I was able to quickly maneuver to a u-turn at the underpass while the asshole who was being aggressive didn't have time to turn and ended up going through the intersection. 

People are either ASSUMING that because it's a small car I'm going to be blocking traffic by driving slowly, or they are actively hating on the fact that it's a small car. 

While it may seem obvious that when I drove the ex-cop car people could have been more intimidated, I never noticed this behavior when I drove small cars in the past. Some of the cars I've driven include a Corolla, Tercel, Shadow, etc. Not intimidating cars, but nothing like this.

Driving in the Houston-Beaumont area on I-10 primarily, I have seen a LOT of aggressive drivers. But what I've seen the last 3 weeks is just insane. I feel like I've got a target on my car saying ""This is the enemy! Open Fire!""...

Am I just having a run of bad luck, or has anyone else observed anything like this?",16,9,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2fo9be/antifiat_road_agression/,1410043632,2fo9be

1. Blue and Me: Only being useful for calls. No navigation, no Bluetooth audio. The message reader doesn't work with most phones. Semi complicated USB audio menus. USB always defaults to random. Changes the order of songs, very irritating if your listening to Darkside of the moon. 

2. Cargo Area: The Mounts for the parcel shelf (that isn't really a parcel shelf) are easily knocked about when moving things in and out of the cargo area. Mine are in poor shape and need remounted/fixed.

3. Arm Rest: No passenger arm rest. 

4. Door pockets: Only half is usable if you plan to get something out of the door pocket while driving. Anything that slides back near the seat is impossible to reach with out opening the door. 

5. Paint: Easily chipped, and the color of the bumpers don't match the body. Very noticeable on some color options (like yellow and green)

6. Passanger seat: No height adjustment, and it also doesnt go back as far as the drivers seat. 

7. USB aux port in glove box: I know this has been moved on the new models.

4172,Blue&amp;Me Issues,snooze_sensei,"Vital stats - '15 Fiat 500 Sport, base radio.

I have a couple questions about the bluetooth support.

The 2015 has bluetooth music streaming, which is new over the older models, so I'm not sure how useful asking here is going to be, but I'll try anyway.

1) When I switch to Bluetooth Streaming on Media, it sends a signal to my phone to launch the default music player. I don't want that! I use Pandora or Doggcatcher or TuneIn - but never the default music player. I'm not sure how to stop it from trying to be too smart here.

2) On the opposite of being too smart, there appear to be not even basic media control supports. Ie, back/forward to not transmit to the phone as it should. Almost any other bluetooth device I've ever used can at least send play/pause/back/forward to the radio. Not the Fiat. It turns on the wrong music player, and off to the races. All you get is volume control.

3) Message reader. Just plain does NOT work. I have a Nexus 5 with 4.4.2 kitkat. Any tips to get the message reader to work? 

4) Nothing to be done about it, I'm sure, but I've noticed that there is a noticeable delay in connecting a call when I answer it through the steering wheel controls.

None of these things were issues with my aftermarket Sony in my old car. It was miles better than this. 

Overall, I'm quite disappointed with the terrible bluetooth support in this Fiat. I love the car, but hate the bluetooth. ",8,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2dwutp/blueme_issues/,1408390440,2dwutp
4173,2014 Fiat 500 : How do you optimize USB media to work with the stereo?,TheWeezel,"I just got my 2014 Fiat 500 Pop.  One of the big selling features for me was the USB media port to let me just plug in a thumb drive and have a ton of music.  I'm in IT so I have a ton of extra drives (usually around 16gb but a few 32's).

I know that the drive must be formatted as FAT32 as NTSF didn't want to run.

The problem that I am having is that it seems to only play songs from a few artists.  When I had the file structure as Artist\Album\Song.mp3 this made some sense so I figured I would see what happens when I move everything up one and eliminate the Artist folder and just have everything as Album\Song.mp3.  In this file structure I still get the works from a few Artist, though it does still play from multiple albums even though they are not next to one another, The band ""They Might Be Giants"" plays songs from both their self titled album and ""Flood"" but skips a dozen folders that fall between F and T.

The artists played are different than before but still only a few of them.

Finally I just put everything in the root directory (1995 songs ordered by track number and then name).  Result:  Still getting music by just a few artists though once again a different set of artists.

I have tried taking it off of random to see if I can get around these limitations and have found that it doesn't.  What the heck is going on and how can I get all my music to play?  Currently I get more music by burning a CD with Mp3's and using that, which makes even having the USB almost completely pointless.

Does anyone have any idea how to get all the songs to play, is my radio defective, or is there some update to the firmware that would fix this?

4178,Possibly buying a Fiat 124 roadster. Unsure what to look for. Advice?,[deleted],"I'm 18 and am interested in buying a classic! My parents own a classic restoration business, but deal mainly in expensive brands such as Cadillac. Thankfully, I'll have them here to help if I ever do find myself with a classic that needs repairs, but right now I'm trying to find which one exactly.
The Fiat 124 roadster is beautiful and exactly what I would like in a car. It's tiny, sporty, and seems like it's worth buying!
I am just unsure what year I should be looking at. Are there any that are more desirable or have certain things that are better than other years?
Are there any problems that they have that I need to be aware of? I know that rust is huge but I'm not sure of what else.
How would you rate it overall? Pros and cons?
I am slowly but surely learning manual, so I probably would want a manual, but if I can't learn it eventually then I'll have to look for an automatic.
I'll be doing more research and stuff tonight, but I just wanted to ask for some input! Thank you!",2,5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2deop5/possibly_buying_a_fiat_124_roadster_unsure_what/,1407904016,2deop5

4183,14 Abarth discounts?,[deleted],"so I'm about to start a lengthy commute, and need to upgrade my ride. My 97 Mazda 626 just has too many miles - 180,000 - for me to depend on. My 96 Crown Vic ex cop car sucks tons of fuel and needs a complete frontend rebuild, and I don't even really like the car. Both are too big.

thus, I'm in the market for a Fiat. Credit not awesome, but I can get approved and have a big down payment. Want to keep the budget down, so the rebates on 14s look sweet. Losing the Bluetooth upgrade would hurt but the rebates allow me to fit more comfortably in my budget.

What I really wanted was a 500 Turbo manual, but stock is running out on 14s... That means downgrading to the much slower trims or upgrading to the Abarth.

So... I see $2500 factory incentive on the 14 Abarth. A few people are claiming that you can get significantly more off than that. I'm curious if anyone knows how much extra dealers are willing to kick in beyond the rebate to move those manual inflicted Abarths.... I've looked at Truecar, but they don't make it clear if that price (around $20k) includes the rebate. if it does that's assuming the dealers aren't budging elsewhere on price. That seems fishy to me because I know rebates aren't really any discount at all from the dealer's pocket.

On the other hand, some dealers are advertising them on websites starting at 17.5k for an Abarth. to me that seems fishy also because I know sometimes that price is artificial, assuming you qualify for every possible discount even mutually exclusive ones.

Anyone got a clear idea on 14 Abarth pricing?I don't want to quibble over a few hundred bucks, but I also don't want to play the ""negotiate below the line"" game and spend much more than I should have to on a car that is moving slowly off of lots.",1,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/2d0rp9/14_abarth_discounts/,1407535639,2d0rp9

The Abarths I've found:


* 2013 Abarth - Nero Black w/ red striping, gray 17"" wheels - 17,300 miles - $19,000
* 2013 Abarth - Blanco w/ red striping, gray 17"" wheels - 14,100 miles - $18,961

4250,500L Buying Opinions?,[deleted],"The SO and I are looking for a new car for her to drive, and have some rather demanding requirements. I am wanting her to test drive a 500L, but the nearest dealer is 90 miles away. So I'm looking for ways to convince her. (btw, we are in Texas, USA)

She has narrowed her list to one of two cars:

1. Nissan Rogue - she feels this is a compromise on MPG but has the space she wants.
2. Toyota Prius V - she feels this is a compromise on price and space as it will be around $30k with options she wants (NAV), but it has the MPG she wants.

We have been looking at vehicles with both high MPG and good cargo space as a requirement. Rear seat room is irrelevant, as the only ""kids"" are a German Shepherd and a Border Collie who will ride tethered in the back. 

Really she doesn't want the Prius V. And the Nissan Rogue is more compromise on MPG than she wanted to make. However, almost every other vehicle that offers better MPG had some other compromise such as lack of space or uncomfortable seating position. 

I looked at the 500L online, and the flip-up seats are exactly what she says she was looking for as it offers a large cargo space in the back when the seats are up, plus it provides a barrier to keep the dogs from nosing the driver! 

It also looks like a rear-seat ""delete"" (removal) would be pretty easy as the area under the seats is already carpeted. 

However, it is a slight compromise on space compared to the Nissan Rogue, and the EPA gas mileage ratings are the same. I personally doubt the Rogue will meet its EPA mpg rating, however, based on a few anecdotal reports I've seen on the internet. 

So I need advice from 500L experts. With the price of the Prius V, it will probably come down to Rogue -vs- 500L. 

* Am I on the wrong path anyway, and the 500L really is too small for someone who needs good space, including good headroom for a 5'11"" person?
* In the real world, does the 500L meet or exceed it's EPA rating more consistently than the 2014 Nissan Rogue? Anyone got documentation/reviews to show that?
* What advantages does the 500L have over the Rogue? 
* What's the buying experience like? If she wants options/colors that aren't available at the dealer or a quick locate, what are the chances she can get a factory order? I know some dealers/brands are very reluctant to do factory orders.

So a few weeks ago I landed a new gig, which has a different start time than the wife's. It's been hard to handle the one car, two jobs deal therefore have begun to think about a new car purchase. 

I didn't want to finance another vehicle  (a new salary right out of college will intoxicate a man like that,) but after flirting with the idea of another used vehicle, I can't for one moment have a non-functioning car (and trust me, I have zero problem fixing minor issues; tune ups,) especially in South Florida.

I remember some of the guys who had bought their Abarths early in the year mentioning deep incentives ($6K.)

4284,I fear for the Fiat brand ...,[deleted],"I live in metro Atlanta and see thousands of cars every day on the way to and from work. While I am sure I miss some of them, I see about 4 Fiat 500s per week on the road, not including the two I see every day whose owners work somewhere in the complex of buildings I park in. I can't think of any other affordable cars, regardless of size, that I see fewer of. You might get the impression that the 500 was a $150,000 car. But it's not.

Even though individual 500 owners will tell you that they love their car, it seems like most of the media reporting on either the car or its parent company are overwhelmingly negative. ""The car is underpowered and doesn't get the mileage it should with it's small size."" Is often a review I read or hear. At least in the manual transmission, I have not at all found the car to be underpowered. I guess they are comparing it to some other small cars, but that is not the way it usually comes off. The company as a whole is attacked repeatedly. 

What concerns me more is that the people who are actually buying the Fiat 500 don't seem to be in the market they are targeting. Everytime I go to the Fiat dealership, most of the 500 drivers are 40+ (including myself). Every now and then I'll see a young person pull in with an Abarth, but they seem to be happier spending their $25k on BRZs, Focus STs, and Civic SIs. And I understand that.

I love my Fiat 500 and read it a bedtime story every night before it goes to sleep, but I just have this sinking feeling like they're not going to be around a long time. Resale value on them is in the toilet.

On the bright side, I do want an Abarth in a couple of years and to be able to get one on the cheap will be my dream. I read on another forum where someone was able to get a 2013 Abarth *brand new* for just under $17k because the dealership wanted to unload the car. I don't know if that's true (this is the internet, after all), but it sounded like a great prospect for me. 

On an unrelated note, I was at the dealership this morning and saw the yellow vinyl wrapped Abarth. It was *amazing*. I did not take a picture of it and cannot find a similar one on the internet at the moment. I want it.

I have recently graduated and entered the workforce and am looking to purchase a hot hatch. I was all but set on an ST2 Focus ST or Fiesta ST (one with the leather recaros) but then I saw [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/27nn15/just_got_my_hands_on_a_2013_fiat_500_abarth/) in /r/cars where the OP said he picked up a leftover 2013 for $16,200. Which is about 9k less than any ST with the options I'd want, *definitely appealing.*

My questions- 

1. Mandatory MPG question
2. Sound system- is the stock one fine? Upgrade to beats worth it? If you have the beats, does the inclusion of the subwoofer greatly affect the cargo space?
3. Modability? I know its just 1.4 liters, but it is turbocharged.
4. Pricing. Are ridiculous deals on the 2013s area specific? I looked at the only Fiat dealer in my area and they had 2 2013 Abarths listed for MSRP. 
5. How much shit can you fit in it.

4309,Is there any way to mod an AUX cable into a Fiat Stilo?,efstajas,"Hi there,

I haven't modded ANYTHING in any car before, but I'm quite good with technology and tinkering.

My stilo has one of the shabby cassette deck players. I'm using ancient cassette to aux adapters that break every few weeks and get more expensive every time. Plus the noise isn't the best.

Is there any way to mod an aux cable into that car? I know you can put one into the back of the standard head unit in a Punto and just have it hanging outside. Will I find a jack hidden behind the head unit in the Stilo, too, and yes, which plug will I need?

4325,Fiat 500: Very faint clicking sound coming from what seems to be the driver's side somewhere?,[deleted],"I'm not going to be able to get my 500 Pop in for service until Monday morning. But because I am an obsessive person, it's going to be a mentally stressful weekend. So here goes:

I noticed it first about a week or so. A very faint clicking sound. I can really only hear it when I have the window(s) down and the stereo off. So this problem may have existed for some time because usually I have the music on. Also, I can't hear it while the engine is revving nor over, say 40 mph because the sound of the road, wind, engine, etc. are just too loud and the sound of the clicking is weak. 

I checked the cv boots and they appear to be in order. The sound doesn't get better or worse when I turn. There doesn't appear to be anything going on with the tire. I did find a small rock stuck in the thread. I haven't driven since removing it, but I doubt that was it because the sound was pretty consistent throughout, not faster as the car went faster. 

It doesn't seem to affect driving at all. It could be, too, that I've been digging in the wrong place. With the small size of the car, it very well could be coming from the rear, too, I guess. I just never thought to check there until now that I am writing this. 

Anyway, I know people usually respond ""take it in to get checked out"". I do have an appointment for next week. I just wanted to see if anyone else had experienced anything at all similar.

My parents aren't a big fan of me driving their cars and therefore I'm now in the market to buy one myself. I'm currently deciding on *whether or not* to buy the Abarth version of the Fiat 500.

The thing is: we recently moved to The Netherlands. Those insanely high taxes drive the prices of a new base model Abarth up to €25.000,-

**My budget is €15.000,-** which forces me to look for a used car.

Would you please help me decide between a **2009-2011 Abarth** *(Mileage: 20k-50k)* or a **2013 Twin Air 500S** *(Mileage: 0-3k)*?

4377,Looking to buy an Abarth... needing your thoughts...,Mekkakat,"I currently am financing a used 2007 Civic Si that I recently had some major issues with. I was struggling to get the darn thing fixed after finding out some hidden flaws the dealer decided to leave out, and to make matters worse... The people that ""repaired"" my car, hammered it and it was this HUGE ordeal with the BBB and all kinds of drama :(


Long story short - I saw the big incentives for Abarths ($4k cash back) and I have good credit.. so I said why not. I went for a test drive and it's a mean little car. Fun, still comfortable, and feels solid. 


I'm taking a hit on my Civic, and am just slightly upside down (1k) if I make this move... The upside is obviously a brand new car and warranty, and a peace at night sleeping, not worrying about what COULD happen - like I do with the Si right now.


---------


500 owners in general (although mostly addressing you Abarth owners)... would you say this is the right move? I know a lot of you really love your cars, so it's clearly silly to ask if you like it or not - but be honest - would you recommend the Fiat lineup? Have you had a good experience and so on?

4388,My first road trip experience in the Fiat 500.,[deleted],"I've had my 2013 500 Pop for 3 months now, but up until now I hadn't really done much more than drive back and forth to work (60 mile round trip). This weekend my wife and I would take a trip from Atlanta to Jacksonville, with a stop off in Savannah. Here are some observances:

Comfort: Surprisingly, the ride was very comfortable in the front seats. Not as comfortable as, say, driving in a Chrysler Town &amp; Country, but for a small car, I was impressed. You did feel the road on rougher parts of the highway, but that's going to be the case in just about any small car. The sound wasn't as bad as i thought it might be, even at an average cruising speed of about 75mph. 

Economy: I averaged about 41mpg. With the aforementioned 75mph, I felt that the mileage was more than acceptable, even though many reviewers think that a car this size should get a bit better gas mileage. I can't complain. 

Power: The on ramps on I-75 in south Georgia and Florida are very short. And the speed limit is 70mph, which means that most of the cars are moving in the 75-85mph range. You really need to punch it as you get on the ramp so that you are at a respectable speed when it's time to merge. While the Turbos and Abarths are not what most people in the ""fast car"" communities would call ""fast"", the extra horses you get would really be a help here. I didn't have a tremendous problem, but if you had 3 or 4 adults in the car and the air conditioner blasting, I can see where this might be the only flaw in the vehicle. Even so, once reaching speed, it required no extra effort to maintain it. 75-80mph was not an issue. (Mind you, many take offense at being passed by the Fiat, so expect to be overtaken *alot* just out of pride.)

The city: All that said, this car was an absolute *dream* in the city. We visited both downtown Jacksonville and Savannah and it handled beautifully and you could park it just about anywhere. Savannah is very touristy and parking can be a hassle there, but the 500 could easily fit where many other cars (even cars like the Hyundai Veloster) could not. 

EDIT: I washed her this morning. Couldn't stand all of the dead bug parts on her face.

4404,Fiat 500 and oil changes? How often?,[deleted],"If I recall (I don't have it right in front of me), the owner's manual indicated that the Fiat would alert you with an indicator of some sort that an oil change is recommended. Does anyone know how long this takes to pop up? Is it based purely on mileage or does the car somehow have a way of measuring the condition of the oil? 

I bought my 500 with 16500 miles on it and it was serviced at the dealership at that time. I just hit 19900 but I haven't seen a warning of any kind. I was assuming it would just pop up at 3k miles like many cars are programmed to do. In all of my previous (non Fiat) cars, I always changed the oil every 5500 miles (or there about) and never had any problems. In my Toyota truck, it recommended 7500 miles.

4438,"Since becoming a 500 owner, random people on the highway are suddenly offended.",[deleted],"For the couple of years leading up to buying my 2013 Fiat 500 Pop, I drove a 2010 Dodge Caravan SXT. This van was neither cute nor fun to drive, but the engine was a beast. It had a 3.8L V6 with 197hp. The 0-60 time on it was right around 8 seconds. That's pretty quick for something the size of a house. But when I drove it, if I passed people (which I often do because I have somewhat of a lead foot), nobody thought I was in any way challenging them. 

Now when I run past people in the Fiat, suddenly they seem to take offense as if to say ""Oh, no he didn't!"" and then it's on. I just let them go on. While I do drive a little fast, I don't race folks. Usually they only speed up to make a point with no real intent to maintain that speed and I often end up passing them later anyway. 

This really only occurs with people with regular cars, for some reason. If I pass vehicles that are obviously menaces (Porsches, BMWs, Turbo anythings), I get no hassle from them. They know they can eat me alive and have no real reason to prove it. But the people in the Camrys, Kias, Accords, Malibus--they just don't like it. 

And I will not speak of the New Beetle drivers in this topic. They are another topic for discussion altogether. ",7,16,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/20zih5/since_becoming_a_500_owner_random_people_on_the/,1395399411,20zih5
4439,Thoughts on extended warranties?,e1ven,"Fiat offers several optional [extended warranty](http://www.fiatusa.com/en/warranty/) for their vehicles. 

As I understand, you can buy these either with a vehicle purchase, or until the original warranty expires, although the price will increase as the vehicle ages.

Many people purchase them from the dealership - It looks like the price is negotiable. The Dealer's cost is [about $2000](http://www.jk-forum.com/forums/jk-talk-26/chrysler-lifetime-maximum-care-234659/page2/) and MSRP is $3000.

They also appear to be available from various online vendors, such as : [example1](http://www.chryslerwarrantys.com/) or [example2](http://www.chryslerfactoryplans.com/). 

I'm curious if people have bought them, and what they're experiences have been.
I suspect that most people would lose money on them, but it might be a good insurance program to avoid an unexpected substantial bill.

4449,Is the advertised MPG for the POP based on Sport mode?,[deleted],"I have a 2013 Pop that I purchased slightly used last month. I found that in really horrible city driving conditions, I average about 37mpg and on the highway I average about 46mpg at an average speed of 65mph. Even at 70, I can get somewhere between 44-45mpg. On the extremely rare occasions (say Saturday mornings at 6am when I am on my way to work) that I can drive 50mph, I can get about 49mpg. 

As advertised, the car should get an estimated 31mpg city and 40mpg highway.

But all of this is with sport mode off. I almost never drive with it on because I know that I will never turn it off again.

4455,New to the Abarth club. Already started making changes to it.,TriggerTX,"A few weeks ago I picked up a leftover new 2013 Abarth. It was fully loaded with goodies for a stupidly low price. I had originally dropped by the dealer to look at a base model Pop for a cheap commuter. I liked it more than I thought. I tested a lot of cars over the next month. I drove a Leaf, a Fit, the Fiesta ST, and a couple others. None did I like as much as the 500 though I almost went for the Leaf.

Then I looked back at the local Fiat dealers' site and saw they had an even lower price on their last 2013 Abarth. Fully loaded, leather, sunroof, Beats stereo, heated seats, nav, 17"" wheels, everything. Someone ticked all the boxes when it was ordered. I called them up and asked if I could take it out for a spin. They were more than eager for me to do so. Just a couple of minutes into the test drive I knew I wanted it. After the drive I talked about the price a bit but we just couldn't agree. My wife and I left.

I got a call a week later asking what it'd take for me to come back and buy the Abarth. I gave them a ludicrously low offer and said if they met that offer with no counter I'd be down in an hour to sign paperwork. The salesman said 'let me run it past my manager'. Three minutes later I hear back 'you have a deal'. An hour later I was driving home in a shiny, new, loud Abarth. :D

It took my wife and I a month from our first step into the dealer to buying the 500 and the dealer was never too pushy. Eager, yes, but never pushy. I liked that.

Here's a pic the day I brought her home. My old daily driver is on the left. 10MPG of 25 year old Range Rover. My weekend car is in the garage. A 1961 Thunderbird Convertible.
http://i.imgur.com/GCKipAQl.jpg

Never one to let things be, I decided I wanted red wheels to match the trim. A few cans of PlastiDip later and I had red wheels. Note my wife's Golf R is on the right. We'll come back to that in a bit.

I then started to get annoyed by the glare from the bright white dash.

I turned this:

Into this:
http://i.imgur.com/ZHdTK21l.jpg

$15 worth of carbon fiber vinyl wrap and the problem is solved.

I love the Abarth. The bang for the buck I got out of it is amazing. My wife has a Golf R. Yes, hers is faster. It has a more comfortable ride. It's got AWD. It can fit 5 people, 4 comfortably. The Abarth just 'feels' faster. You're closer to the ground and it's very loud. The exhaust note is captivating. Those cracks and pops when you're hard on the gas make me grin from ear to ear and giggle like a school girl.

Now I'm starting to look for a tune to give it just a little more oomph. I'd like to be able to keep up a bit better with my wife's car. :D

I've seen on eBay that you can purchase something [like this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Fiat-Grande-Punto-Alfa-159-Car-Stereo-Aux-Input-Adaptor-for-3-5mm-iPod-iPhone-/370810987173?_trksid=p2054897.l4276) and you can play a phone or MP3 player. 

Three questions:

* Could someone please tell me if the thing I've link is in fact that correct part?

* Is the Aux setting accessed by pressing ""CD"" twice?

* Is it easy to feed the cable through to the glove box or down to the could holder area?

4470,PSA: Headlamp troubles.,hollywoodbob,"Ladies and Gentlemen, I'd like to bring your attention to something, that if you haven't experienced yet, you might in the not to distant future. The problem of a blown headlamp on a Fiat 500. 

Now while a blown headlamp may not seem like much, especially since they're quite easy to remove and replace. There is however a very large difficulty in procuring the replacement bulb. The 500 uses a rare coated bulb, a Philips 9012 H1R2 Halogen bulb, that doesn't appear to be carried by any popular parts house. I don't live in a large metro area, and I'm about 75 miles from my nearest studio, but my city if fairly good sized and I assumed that it wouldn't be a problem, surely one of the dozen auto parts places in town would have them. Sadly I spent a solid hour driving from place to place trying to find one, without any luck.

If you're not close to your studio, you can order them from Amazon here: [Philips 9012 Standard Halogen Headlight](http://www.amazon.com/Philips-9012-Standard-Halogen-Headlight/dp/B00480N18G).

For financial reasons, I opted to stick with the Pop version instead of moving up to the Sport or Abarth iterations, but I was still excited by this car. I'm still getting used to the noise levels, but that is because for the past few years I drove a big van.

I also found it to be surprisingly spry and quick, even when loaded down with four adults.

It was actually my second choice for a vehicle. My first choice was the Hyundai Veloster but I felt that they were just a bit too proud of that vehicle with their MSRP. And I also liked the drive/handling of the Fiat better. 

I think I made the right choice.

I use google and I narrow the results down to the last 2 months or so with the search options as the links go dead once the cars are up for too long, probably being sold or often withdrawn to be tried to be sold again at a later date.

You can remove ""anni"" from the above search request to include all the modern FIAT's too.

If it helps, I'm not really sure what kind of options on her car she selected, but for what it's worth she can plug in her iPhone/iPod and control the songs through her steering wheel. Speaking of which, if MP3 CDs don't play on the Abarth, I'm thinking about buying a cheap MP3 player (you can get them for like 20 bucks nowadays). Other non-Apple MP3 players definitely work on the car, right?

4560,Abarth as a long term daily driver?,phadeone,"Hello everyone. I am quite interested in an Abarth as my next car. I do have a few questions though that I am hoping you guys can answer.

I currently drive a 2007 Honda Accord sedan. It is a good car. Reliable, safe, quick enough around town and on the highway...but it is abysmally boring. No character, so soul. Pure point A to point B. I am still working on selling the idea of the 500 to my wife. She just automatically dismisses them as ""clown cars,"" but she has agreed to go on a test drive with me to humor me. Hopefully that test drive will come soon. I do have some questions prior to a test drive that I'm hoping you guys can answer. Mainly, would you guys think the Abarth is a good long term daily driver? I'm talking literally everything. Drive to work, school, out on the town etc...My wife has her own car but hates driving so unless she's going to work, I'm driving us in my car. I bought the Accord in 2010 with 70,000 miles on it and as it sits now I've put nearly 60,000 miles on it in just over 3 years. I wouldn't be putting quite as many miles on the Abarth since my current job is no longer a 30 mile one way drive, but still. I expect to take my next car on at least one road trip every year (250+ miles each way), plus if the car is actually fun to drive, there's no telling how much ""just for fun"" drives I'll go on.

My next question has to do with my possibly expanding family. My next car must be able to easily fit a baby seat. There is no definite plans of future spawn, but it is a possibility and I don't want to have to trade the car in a year or two down the line because a kid wont fit in the back.

My third question is reliability and maintenance cost. Fiat hasn't been in the states in quite a few years, and I am not old enough to remember when they were sold previously. I am sure their quality has much improved since they were last offered though, and I have heard nothing but praise about the 500 from European and North American press. Is the Abarth a reliable car? Will I be able to beat on it and put 15,000+ miles a year on it? What is the maintenance schedule like? What does routine maintenance at the dealership cost approx? I'm used to taking the Accord in every 7000 miles or so (when the onboard computer tells me) and oil change + tire rotation was ~$80.

Overall cargo space is not a huge factor. The back seat of my Accord has only been used maybe twice since I bought the car, and the only thing that the trunk is used for is my subwoofer and amp. So I think I will be plenty ok with the space in the 500.

That's about all I can think of right now. If there is anything else you guys think I should know please tell me! I appreciate any answers. :)",26,11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/1rbzd6/abarth_as_a_long_term_daily_driver/,1385269016,1rbzd6

I do medieval combat, and go camping (sometimes both), so I also need to fit weapons and camping gear in it.

Also, I can not drive stick (manual shift, my dad never taught me, so grrr!); according to official websites, I see Fiats tend to be manual shift; are the Fiats 500L manual/stick, or automatic shift?

I am an American living in America, so how easy is it to get car parts and have it serviced for when issues arise?

4573,Trying to choose my first FIAT,lgstoian,"Hello folks.

I used to own a Suzuki Swift but I have sold it recently and I'm looking for a new bigger car. As a big Italian car fan I could't resist the allure of purchasing a new FIAT. 
There is no contender when it comes to the brand as I am dead set on an Italian car , would of went for an Alfa if the bugged allowed it ... still might push my budget to get one .. but I transgress. 

I have been to the dealer and after seeing the cars and discussing fiances I have arrived to 3 contenders : 
- 500L Star Pop with the 1.4 95 HP petrol engine Euro 6
- Bravo 1.4 M-Air 140 HP petrol engine Euro 5
- Facelift Linea 1.3 95 HP diesel Euro 5B

The 500L is my favorite by far as looks go but , sadly enough , I can only afford the worse engine in the lineup and not a particularly high trim level. For the same money I can get the other two with far better equipment and superior engines. 

The Bravo would be the best equipped model having stuff like Hill Holder , Cruise Control , Traction Control and an engine that has the potential to be quite entertaining.

The Facelifted Linea attracts me with it's 1.3 Diesel engine that has the best MPG of the three by far. Also after the facelift the interior looks way better and comes with a trim level that is situated between what I get on the Bravo and 500 L.

Thanks in advance for any info you have to share.

As for what I require in a car ... I'd say space for passengers and for my luggage foremost followed by the fact that it would be nice if the car is fun to drive and doesn't become tedious on long drives , going with the Swift on holiday was horrendous to say the least  .

So I wanna know the opinions you , the owners of these cars , have. 
Would you still make the same choice after you lived with it for a while?
Which car do you thing would be most suited based on my needs ? 
Also is the 1.4 engine on the 500L that bad or not ?",13,10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/1ohxu0/trying_to_choose_my_first_fiat/,1381841651,1ohxu0

4576,do you get your oil changed at the studio you purchased your fiat from? do you go to another garage?,rpare89,"Rather embarrassingly I'm slightly past due for my first oil change.(I forgot I had conventional and not synthetic oil in the new car). I want to take it back to the dealership so I can have a service record on file, and because I've been told that taking my vehicle to a shop not authorized by fiat could in a sort of de facto way void my warranty. The studio I purchased from is inconveniently far away, luckily there's a newer closer studio that I can take my car to. I was just wondering where do you all go to get your servicing done?

Also I found out about a change in my service agreement from my previous 2012 and my new 2013:

I had a 2012 pop, and I used to get complimentary oil changes, I thought that this was part of the warranty. I recently upgraded to a 2013 sport. When I called to ask if I could schedule a complimentary oil change at a different dealership I was informed that new fiats no longer carry that service agreement!

I installed a Britax B-Safe infant car seat on both sides using the LATCH system. The installation was easy overall but I'm also paranoid so will likely get it double checked

I liked the install better on the passenger side for a number of reasons. First, the driver side would be very snug for a 5'4"" frame postpartum. Second, getting the actual car seat into the car felt ""easier"" on the passenger side for some reason. You do lose a ton of functionality of the passenger seat (only the very short would fit comfortably) it is still functional for three people or four if the driver is also a bit short.

4630,"New owner, or thinking about purchasing a Fiat 500?",[deleted],"Here are some aesthetic and mechanical manufacturing issues you should be aware of before doing so.

Model: Fiat 500 Abarth (Possibly other trims as well)

***Issue: Paint  bubbling and/or chipping above the front emblem.***

Photo: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ZH4Dmgn.jpg)

Note: This issue is allegedly due to an over tightening of the emblem at the factory when the paint is still in a semi soft state. In effect, the paint above the emblem begins to bubble, and will eventually begin to chip. 
***
Model: All 500 Models

**Issue: Defective Coolant Reservoir Clamp**

Photo: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/LjOL4Lp.jpg)

Note: If you check the coolant reservoir, and the fluid level is low, keep a keen eye out for dried coolant on top of the reservoir. Allegedly, the hose clamp on the tubing leading to the reservoir is clamped improperly.  This issue is corrected by replacing the factory clamp with a worm-drive style hose clamp. If you decide to replenish the coolant yourself, DO NOT use a third party coolant. Only use the Fiat approved OAT coolant (you've been warned).
***

Model: All 500 Models

**Issue: Rear Main Seal Leak**

Photo: [Oily Residue Shown] (http://i.imgur.com/ipYCXsW.jpg)

Note: Another manufacturing defect, the nefarious rear main seal leak. This issue is a bit harder to observe, as you need to check the underside of the rear of the engine. This issue will present itself as an oily film, and can indeed be dangerous if not corrected. It is recommended to have your local Fiat Studio check for this issue during your first oil change interval.
***

Model: All 500 Models

**Issue: Transmission Fluid Leak**

Photo: None at this time (similar to the rear main seal leak photo above -- for comparison)

Note: Just as the rear main seal leak, the transmission fluid leak presents itself in a similar manner (an oily like residue on the transmission housing). The transmission is usually known to leak from the seams were the transmission and other mechanical components mate together (5th gear housing, etc). Again, you can properly check this by inspecting the transmission housing of the vehicle.
***

Model: 500 Abarth

**Issue: Side Skirt Separation**

Photo: [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Oc4a6TD.jpg)

Note: As stated above, the side skirts on the Abarth model become separated and unglued. It is suspected that the adhesive and/or methods used to apply the side skirts are the culprit. Also,  I want to add -- if proper care is not taken when the vehicle is placed on a lift, this may also be a cause of separation (if the lift arms do not have elevated points of contact at the end, the surface area that sits flush with the pinch weld could overlap the bottom of the side skirt, in effect placing some of the force on the skirt itself). 
***
More issues will be added to this list as they are discovered.
