I've taken it on a 400-mile road trip and toward the end it was bothersome. The sound system is good so you can use it to drown out the drone. 

The way the car handles is awesome. It definitely encourages you to take corners fast. 

 As for space, if you're creative you can fit a snowboard in there. It fits a bike too if you take the wheels off. 

  Insurance was pretty cheap. 
Maintenance is easy. One known problem is an oil leak in the PCV valve. I believe it sits above the engine and it's easy to see if there's any oil leaking. The O ring is about 5 bucks and you can do the job yourself in about 10min.

78,MetalMattyPA,hbben2f,t1_hba72fv,p6f55k,"It's just better to drive. It literally eradicated every issue I felt the Sport had. 

To answer the first half of your question, yes. The Sport actually wasn't THAT bad through 1st and 2nd gear on flat ground, but if you hit even the *smallest* incline it was done. You were pedal to the floor, engine screaming to make that incline. I live in Pennsylvania... We have a LOT of inclines. Because of this, fuel mileage was extremely meh as well. On a 55mph highway I was happy to hit 30mpg, and in town because of stop and go and how hard you had to be on throttle, I was happy with 24mpg, maybe. Handling actually wasn't that bad on the Sport, especially mine which was lowered, but traction control (which cannot be fully shut off on the Sport) would *ALWAYS* intervene, so while occasionally you could toss it into a corner and skate around, usually TCS would ruin the fun. When ignoring the TCS issues, the Abarth is just tighter. Even stock suspension there is less understeer and body roll. Braking performance however I would say is equal between them and really comes down to tires and brake quality. The transmission feel could not be more different. The Sport felt clunky and slow, speed shifting felt like you were breaking stuff. The Abarth has one of the best transmissions I've driven in awhile. It's smooth and fast, has great throw. 

Now onto the second part... 

So nobody cares when you drive a non-Abarth 500. Mine was gorgeous. It was yellow, lowered, and had a set of $1100 wheels on it. It had a muffler delete and Magnaflow resonator and sounded incredible. 

Nobody cared. 

The Abarth however people *ADORE*. I don't know if it's just the exhaust, the turbo whistle, the red/white, or what, but people just seem to understand that it's a bit different than the 10 other normal 500s in town. It's neat. 
The one piece leather seats are better for my tastes, plus they are heated (not sure if either was an option on a non-turbo). 
My Abarth doesn't have a sunroof, which is a big plus for me being that I'm 6'4. 
All in all though it's just *cool* to know you have an Abarth and get to hear all the fun noises. It's such a fun car.",1630591057.0,3

86,parismav,fpo3rfs,t3_geddik,geddik,"Hello,

I had a similar experience with my 2010 punto evo turbo (multi-air).If your engine is multi-air as well, this might be the problem:\*\* note that I'm not a car mechanic, this is what I was told\*\*

Multi-air is a system that somehow controls the distribution/ratio to the valves. It's awfully designed (according to my ""italian car expert"" mechanic) because it's screwed on top of the valves. So after usage, it can sligthly unscrew and eventually pop off one or more valves.He solved it by re-carving the screws and re-screwing the multi-air along with some special glue to keep it stable. He said that normally, they would advise you to get a new multi-air, or even a new engine. But his solution was the most cost-efficient one.

Before him, I talked to 2-3 other mechanics (the ones I trusted until I went to him). People were telling me that one of the pistons was probably broken, others said that I need a new engine (\~2k dollars). I was desperate, until I went to this guy who had seen this problem before and solved it for a few hundred $.

Hopefully this helps. But if you're not running multi-air, probably not.

Edit: for me, I was idle under a red light and suddenly my ""check engine"" light went on, and the car lost its power. It gurgled and struggled to accelerate, while after a few minutes white smoke would come out of the exhaust (meaning it's burning too much oil?). I immediately called the pickup truck and stopped driving it.",1588777847.0,2

She wanted $11,500 and I talked her down.

Abarth is a hard car to sell here in the USA since it has such a unique user base so finding a private seller would be the way to go, because they don't get many bites and you can usually negotiate if the price seems high. As others have said, have the car brought to a local mechanic near the seller and ask them to check it out to make sure there are no issues.

I recommend looking at [cargurus.com](https://cargurus.com), [cars.com](https://cars.com), [craigslist.org](https://craigslist.org), Facebook Marketplace, etc. for Abarth's for sale and continue looking over the course of several weeks/ months - don't just jump at the first one you see because there are great deals to be found (you might have to travel a few hundred miles to pick it up but it will be worth it if you find your dream Abarth).",1584285047.0,1

The Abarth doesn't need it because the turbo acts as a sort of muffler to begin with, that + the catalytic converter leave a good mellow sound.

You'd have to modify an Abarth exhaust to fit on top of that, so it's not even a boltup.

‚Ä¢ The FIAT has a low resale value so if you are looking to purchase a used FIAT you might find a really good deal. I personally found mine with only 16k miles for $9K.
‚Ä¢ The FIAT is scheduled to be discontinued in the US... not sure how this will affect your decision.
‚Ä¢ The Miata an exceptionally well made car... many people after getting their first Miata  end up being loyal customers for life.

I personally really like my FIAT. It‚Äôs a great city car and very popular here in LA. In a few years when I am ready to replace it, I would have gotten another Fiat but, sadly, they‚Äôre being taken off the market. 

 I would get a Miata if I did not live in such a big gross city. For years I drove a convertible but switched to a car with hard top after moving to LA because I would be sitting in traffic with the top open getting asphyxiated by the filthy exhaust from all the useless SUVs. The sunroof on the Fiat has been a nice compromise, gives me a feeling of openness but also extremely easy to close when I need it. Honestly, I have really enjoyed the Fiat and will be sad in a few years when it is time to change cars. I‚Äôve taken the car everywhere including dozens of trips to the mountains for skiing.

My advice to you would be...  if you can find a pre-owned FIAT in excellent condition with low mileage for an irresistible price, go for it.  Otherwise, get the Miata.",1572491388.0,3

Personally, it's hard to compare the two, because each has its own merits. I personally think it's worth it, so if you can afford it or just need to own a convertible, then go get it. But I guarantee after you drive 124 for a bit, you'll miss the growliness of the Abarth.",1560045206.0,3

Went to fiatusa and they said they can't do anything and offerend an apology and that it never should have happened.

Went to the GM of the dealership and he apologized and said that never should have happened.

I took a chance with Fiat, everyone told me they're not reliable and the dealerships don't stand behind the brand. I figured every car has it's issues and it won't happen to me.

As to #1, that's a bummer.  I had a Tacoma that had an aftermarket kit that would trick the GPS/ECU into thinking the vehicle was standing still, was activated by 5 consecutive up and downs on the steering wheel volume control.

Hey all, I've owned my 2013 500 Abarth for about two months now, and I love the thing. However, when I was driving yesterday my check engine light, ESC unavailable light, and hill start unavailable came all all within about a mile of each other (HS and ESC went out at the same time). Car is running fine, but I took it to three separate auto parts stores to have the codes read, but none of their scanners can read it. Hill start is definitely offline, and I thought I heard a slight knocking coming from the back passenger tire area when I hit a few bumps this morning, but I'll need to drive it more to be sure.

Nothing has been done to the car, although this is the first time that I've owned it that we've really been in winter weather. A few inches a snow and below freezing with overnight temps under 20F for a few days straight so I'm hoping it's just to do with that. Before I make the hour drive to the nearest dealership willing to look at, I thought I'd ask here in case it's a commonish issue

527,j44422,e9on4mu,t1_e9olva2,9x0fdh,"Could it be the brake light switch? Possibly. European cars and electrics never work well together so its a possibility but there could be a whole range of things to explore however brake light switch just seems to be the most common cause 

The part cost me ¬£8 in the UK so its worth while getting it replaced. My local mechanic fitted it for me for free but if you are quite handy any one should be able to do it themselves. I was going to have a crack at it myself but then left it to the pros

Also its worth noting my check bulbs light comes on about once a week but goes away next time I turn over the engine, just another part of a FIATs Italian charm :D

The errors/warning lights would come on anytime I put my foot on the brake, since getting the switch replaced it now only comes on if I brake hard and suddenly or if I press the brake right to the floor. For reference these were the warning I would get....

- EPS Failed
- Hill Holder Failed
- Start Stop Unavailable
- Cruise Control Unavailable 

And they werent just warnings it was true as they are all pretty easy to tell whether they were working or not

after getting the switch replaced I now only get these errors but as before only if i brake hard...

Maintenance interval service costs never raised any eyebrows on my part nor have oil changes. I let the ECU tell me when to change my oil an it usually picks about every 6500 miles or so. I drive fairly hard too. My car burns about 3/4 quart oil per 1000 miles, which is typical. Although my car is on the high end of the oil-burn scale; I think its first owner wasn't kind to it during the break-in period...

Other than that, I haven't had any major issues. Had a wheel bearing go around 35k. Brakes replaced around 45k. MAP sensor failure, replaced under warranty. Side skirts beneath the doors came unglued (common), replaced under warranty. Had a spark plug burn out on me about 3 months ago. Put the car into limp mode, it was really unhappy. The end was basically melted off. The other 3 plugs looked fine, so tech chalked it up to a bad plug. I have a boost leak somewhere too (another common issue) but it's not that bad and I'm too lazy to find it.

The engines are solid though. The two common weak points are boost leaks and ignition issues. Both of which can be fixed fairly easily through patience and aftermarket parts. Speaking of, the aftermarket is pretty strong for the cars. Mine has a mild tune to about 185 hp, intake, upgraded coil packs and it's been super solid for 25k miles.

I would personally be wary of a car running that much power, then returned to stock, without having more intimate knowledge of it. 

When you test drive, make sure you (warm up the car) and do a few strong pulls up to redline. See if the car hesitates on the way up; this can be a sign of boost leaks. Some cars will get breakup at high RPMs too; this isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a symptom of the weak stock coil packs from the factory. 

Other than that, nothing really to look for per se. Get a pre-purchase inspection done at a mechanic you trust, though finding one that knows the cars well might prove difficult because they're so niche. Take it through some corners too, that's where the car really shines. :)

My car does have a spare tire mounted. Both hitches described here will let you keep your spare tire. Both are much easier to mount if you remove the muffler and the spare tire mount while doing the install.

I bought the **Draw-Tite** hitch online as it seemed to be the simplest (and slightly cheaper option) to install. I work at a car dealership so one of the technicians was going to install it for me. It did not go well. This hitch mounts on the bumper supports and has an arm that mounts to the holes on the frame on the right side. The bolts attaching the bumper reinforcement bar were in the way of the mounting points for the hitch. The technician said he could make it work but not without grinding or cutting the bolts in the way. Bolts that hold the rear bumper on the car. Sent that hitch back and bought the Mopar one.

The **Mopar** original accessory hitch was the one I should have bought in the first place. Trying to save a few dollars was not worth the trouble. This one mounts to the car's frame (more secure than the bumper supports), uses existing mounting holes and it is much better quality than the Draw-Tite.

Obviously the Draw-Tite one must work for some people because it has a lot of decent reviews, but there are also a lot that say they run into fitment issues like I did. I'd advise spending the extra few dollars for the OEM hitch if you are in the market.",1535835793.0,1

1 1976 Mustang II. V8  4 Speed Manual
2 1976 Chrysler Cordoba. Auto
3 1982 Ford Escort. 4 Speed Manual
4 1982 Buick Regal. Auto

8 2011 Kia Optima. 6 Speed Manual
9 2014 Hyundai Veloster Turbo. Auto
10 2018 Fiat 124 Spider Lusso. Auto

You can see the progression there from young and dumb. Power at all costs, to OMG, I'm out of the military now and have to be financially responsible, to married with kids, to fuck it I want a fun car, to no way my kids are learning to drive using my clutch, to myfuckingextookeverythingandnowIhavetogetacheapcartogettowork, to wow... something close to a sports sedan I can afford new, to look at me, I'm getting older and can get a zippy car, to I'm in my mid 50's, fuck you all I'm getting what I really want...



I love driving a stick. I hate driving a stick in rush hour traffic because I'm getting old and I beat the shit out of my body when I was young and I have arthritis in my knees...


After driving all 3 trims of the 124, I knew I wanted things the Classica just didn't have. Namely, leather. I also knew that given the fact that I'm never going to track it, the Abarth, though a blast, is sprung just a bit too tight for my tastes. I really wanted something closer to a GT car. The Lusso did it for me. My requirements were Saddle Leather, every available option, and just about anything other than red or silver.


The one Loaded out Lusso by me happened to be Puro Bianco Perla with the auto. I have to say the auto in this thing does a damned good job. When I put my foot down, it doesn't hesitate on the downshifts, and it doesn't upshift too soon when I'm driving it hard. When cruising in traffic, it does a good job of keeping the revs down and the MPGs up. In manual mode, shifts are reasonably crisp. Good enough not to suck the fun out of it... and as a bonus, the up/down shift in manual mode is set up correctly... Forward for downshift, back for upshift, the way a sequential rally shifter is set up, not backwards like most of them.  I don't miss paddle shifters at all. Had them on my VT and could never get used to it. I always used the shift lever instead in manual mode.


Before you let auto/manual be a deal killer, drive it. See how you like it. Think hard about how you're actually going to use it. What proportion of your driving is really going to be hard core driving where you would benefit from a stick vs auto?


And fuck the dweebs who are going to laugh at you for driving an automatic. It's _YOUR_ car, not theirs. 
If you really, really want a stick, then don't settle just because all you can find is an auto. Don't buy something you'll be sorry you bought. Buy what you want. Life is too short to compromise. I compromised for too long as should be obvious from the list of cars I've owned.",1527036211.0,3

I've just turned over 50k on my 2013 and the worst niggles I've dealt with were a failed MAP sensor and a cylinder misfire (car's stock ignition system isn't the greatest). MAP was replaced under warranty and the misfire was solved with aftermarket coil packs. 

Be aware that the cars burn oil, it's just how they are. How much they burn can vary. Mine goes through about a quart between changes, which is on the high side. I suspect my car's first owner didn't respect the break in period. But it's not an issue. I make sure to check levels regularly.

With regards to trucks, they have no issue seeing an abarth next to them. Much better than a smart car. Also forgot about one, I was coasting at 50 mph, suddenly an ambulance runs the light at the intersection ahead of me, the car had excellent braking response and distance (even while traveling downhill).

I don't know about driving in Michigan, but we recently had about 8 inches in MD. Abarth had no issues getting around. Only problem is that if there are ice chunks on the road, you'll want to drive around them because the car is low to the ground, don't want to scratch anything.

It's a super fun car, I've only ever fallen more and more in love with it. Pop it into sport mode at a stop light, you'll leave everybody else behind and sound good doing it. And in my opinion, the stock engine sounds better than some of the tune ups you can get.

Other times they're everywhere. This previous time, there was sleet mixed in so there were quite a few slick spots and the trucks didn't really salt, only plowed. The thing that really works out for the car is that you can turn the electronic stability control to partial if it's deep snow, and it's a manual so you can start in 2nd gear (never start higher than that or you'll get major clutch wear) and it's light enough that it's not going to slide around everywhere.

I hit a few slick spots with the most recent snowfall and the car seemed to fare through them really well

Editing: I guess the best way to describe driving the abarth is like a really fun go-kart. That is, you feel everything in the street and the steering is super responsive and strong. I've taken corners pretty quickly and never even heard the tires screeching yet. You don't feel everything in the road in an uncomfortable manner either, the ride in my opinion is super comfortable.

Yes the Abarth comes with a things upgraded over the Fiat 500 but you can make the same arguments for the GTI and the Golf. Modding from the factory is more of a brag thing to explain to your pals. How good your car is should be based on what it has, not what has been changed.

Once you scrap that idea, decide on what you kinda want out of a car. If you were going to modify it like you did with your GTI, the GTI is a much better platform. I know guys with Abarths and once they exceed the 220hp threshold, the car becomes kinda hard to daily drive. Keep in mind that it has a higher than GTI center of gravity and a short wheelbase. If you're just going to slap an intake and tune on the car, both cars will do this well.

I'm considering getting rid of the gti due to the costs of maintaining it. 

I would want a warranty to potentially cover things like that?

It seems like the major things in the abarth are solid but everything else is of cheap nature. Well I mean it is a cheaper car so I would be happy with solid things that matter. 

Rambling, but idk if it's worth it to keep putting money into the gti when I could go newer car route. I'd like to go abarth if I do go newer car, but if I'm leaving my gti due to reliability is the abarth reliable enough to warrant the change.

829,rajethesta,dvr8k0r,t1_dvr5q92,84onct,"Thanks for your input. 

I guess I used 'moded from factory' incorrectly. I meant that more as I wouldn't have to put more money into the abarth being that it already has interesting things done to it and I wouldn't have to put additional money. 

If I did go through abarth route I probably wouldn't do anything to it aside from a cai for additional turbo noise. 

The power difference between the two doesn't bother me as the abarth seems like it would be more fun to drive. 

The test drive will ultimately decide if it's form is comfortable for me. 

I suppose my main concerns would be of my gti is a ticking time bomb then I would want to get rid of it now so that I can have more value to sell it and put towards the new car. 

If I kept the gti and something catastrophic happened it would sell for less. 

If I did go abarth route it'd probably be 2013 I would be looking at due to prices being under $11k. I'd be concerned about reliability. 

I've read almost every thread I could about reliability and everyone goes back and forth with all cars have lemons to horror stoires, to people loving their car. 

I could run the gti into the ground but I feel like putting any money into a car that is just going to continue going downhill it might be a better idea to get something with 100k less miles and newer. 

I guess I really like the idea of getting a new car but it would be stretching my finances a little tighter than I like. Do able, but not sure if it's worth it.

836,PlasmaChemist,dvf413m,t3_831xzi,831xzi,"I have a 2013 Abarth and I spend about 2 hours in it per day on the highway.  I often find myself in the 80+ MPH zone (unless you‚Äôre a cop) and I don‚Äôt notice any droning going on.  I generally keep the back seats laid down so that I can better enjoy the sound (especially the occasional backfires!).  I do, however have the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù sound system, which may mask any drones.

I live in Denver, where it snows.  I have never had any issues with getting around in the snow and ice, even though I only have all-season tires.

I‚Äôve gone about 56,000 miles so far and have never had any problems putting fuel in it.  I insert the nozzle, squeeze the handle, and wait until it‚Äôs full. No stop and go.

As for issues, it tends to drink a bit of oil.  Doesn‚Äôt leak, doesn‚Äôt smoke, it‚Äôs just gone.  It is a mystery.  

I had a GoPedal for a while, then added an ECU which allegedly increased the horsepower to a number I‚Äôve forgotten, but the effect is pretty great.  The GoPedal died, but the ECU is still kicking and creating smiles every day.  I also added a short shifter.

I took it auto-crossing twice, which was a blast.  Wound up on three wheels a few times.

Complaints: 
The interior doors get marked up by my (apparently) very abrasive elbows. 

People can‚Äôt hear me very well when I answer the phone via Bluetooth.

838,EddieIzzardsWardrobe,dw0jazj,t3_831xzi,831xzi,"I own a modded '13 Abarth and have driven it through three Vermont winters.

With regard to snow: Even with snow tires, the 500 Abarth is a terrible winter platform. The wheel base is astonishingly short and the Abarth's low clearance makes snow of any depth a potential challenge. You'll find yourself cringeing as you nail chunks of ice and frozen muck coming off other cars. I've had instances where I almost got stuck in rutted snow because the car would plow and lift on the snow between the ruts. That said, if you can pick your spots and drive after roads are plowed (or before they get too deep), the car will do fine. 

On the highway, the Abarth is stable and confident at speed. I've pushed it over 100mph and never felt concerned. The high profile makes crosswind a factor, but the chassis/suspension really do very well at speeds of 80+. Noise is another matter. At 80mph cabin noise is going to be significant. Leaving the back seats up can help marginally, but anyway you cut it, it's a loud ride.

839,MischaTheJudoMan,dvkb5qe,t3_831xzi,831xzi,"I got a '14 abarth 500 about a month ago, already put 1000 miles on it. Bought it with about 40k miles. Before this car, I had a 1999 Lexus rx 300, which was an amazing car, but I figured it was time to go smaller and more fun. 

I did lots of research on cars, got lots of opinions, and for my tastes, the abarth seemed worth it. I stuck with 2014 because that's when they really stepped up the quality to make it last longer. However, since I've only had it for a month, I can't say anything about the reliability. 

However! 

This is the most fun car I've ever driven. It always surprises me how quickly it can accelerate, even when not in sport mode. Merging onto busy roads and highways is a breeze. The engine sounds amazing, especially when you rev it up going through a tunnel with the windows down. This car is making me a car enthusiast already. 

I did however notice something. Other driver's attitude towards you depends on the car you drive. In my old Lexus, people were always more or less courteous to me when I'm switching lanes, driving through a parking lot, etc. They are much less polite when I'm in the abarth. Maybe it's just me, but good thing it drives like a gokart because lots of times, people speed up to close gaps when the see my blinker, but I can just zoom ahead of them anyway when the car ahead speeds up a bit. 

For fun, I think it was worth the buy. Time will tell with the reliability but I've heard that it can go 90K+ miles with no major issues. 

Took it on a 2.5 hour road trip, stayed at 75-80 mph, car drove fine and had plenty of pickup at those speeds still. Engine is a bit noisy, but you can't hear the wind much (like some other people suggest) and you can drown the engine sound out easily with the radio",1520834863.0,2

what I would suggest doing is moving over all your sensors from the old motor to the new motor and ignore that crank sensor. If you haven't done this, do it, including any wiring harnesses etc.

the reason because is it's possible that some of the sensors or injectors/coils are wired opposite. For example, an injector could be wired + and - on the 2015 and on 2013 it could be - and + on the wires, just swapped around.

I would use the computer that came with your car to run the used engine you got. It sounds like your car might be in theft protection mode to be honest. You cannot simply swap and ecu.

I would put my money on this: In the multi-air engine, if oil is not primed then your valves won't open. This means no air (or fuel) will go through the engine.


Make sure you have enough oil in the engine. How many times would you say you have cranked the engine? At least 10? This should prime the brick. You may need to crank even more than this. Make sure to give your starter a break, it can overheat after a few cranks in succession.

Her verdict for my question was that it IS fun, and thus Abarth/Turbo should be proper amount of fun, but she'd never get one again just because of that Italian QC.

From zipping in it for half the first day - sports mode is interesting, but in all the side pillar visibility is seriously lacking and 500 is extremely underwhelming of a tiny hatch. I drove friend's Fit a few times, and Fit feels faster despite being a pig in comparison and that's just disappointing.

If you do buy this car. Do yourself a favour and swap out the coil packs for Alfa 4C coil packs (and new NGK plugs) at the same time. You will instantly notice more power, car starts a bit faster and runs a LOT smoother.

Next thing to check is strut mounts/top hats. This will be apparent if there is a ""clunk"" coming from the strut when you turn at low speed or hit pot holes. It's a relatively easy fix as inexpensive fix. You will need an alignment after changing them.

Next would be rear shocks. The OEM rear shocks have very shitty rubber bushings. Shocks are cheap. Look at the kyb corvette shock replacement option, or, if you don't feel like changing the suspension, just go OEM again. They are cheap.

Other than that, not much else to really look at. Down the road you'll want an intake and GFB diverted valve. The OEM one is made of cheap plastic and leaks.

Brakes: $600 front/rear OEM rotors and pads

Wheel Bearings: All four replaced. Fronts cost more than the rear. Three were under warranty. The only one I paid out of pocket cost me $90

Shifter Linkage: Rubber bushing failed. Replaced with Silicone aftermarket variant:$60

My turbo wastegate actuator issue was fixed under warranty, also verify with any vehicle you're seriously considering if the rear alignment is in order. Some of the 2012/2013s were being improperly secured by the transport companies, which resulted in misaligned rear. Shims fix the issue, but better to find a healthy car from the getgo.

That's it so far. Enjoy the purchase if you decide to proceed!

You can predictably kick out the rear on U-turns if you want as opposed to the Porsche. Plus if you blow the engine in an 8 year old Porsche that's 10-15k repair, but Abarth engines came in every dodge dart so they're everywhere. Which also means you could tune the Abarth to pretty closely match the base Cayman's performance and not really worry about it. Doing maintenance is also easier than the Porsche which requires being underneath to get to everything. Also I believe caymans didn't come standard with LSD like the Abarth. Plus interchangeability with all Miata chassis components. Cayman's are cool, but the amount of car for the money and the gamble on Porsche repairs doesn't make a whole lot of sense compared with other cars. just my 2 cents ",1506729138.0,8

Maintenance is Maintenance...it'll happen eventually. Fiat dealers are hard to come by if you need repairs and likely out of the way. Porsche dealers are a lot more accessible. Porsche's are also generally maintained by the dealership they were bought from, and normally the owners take pride in them and well care for them.

1041,,dn5eqh0,t1_dn4gtgc,70lf0z,"So I've owned my Abarth since new in 2014. Have driven in Ontario snow and Nova Scotia snow and driven in snow storms between the two provinces. If you have decent tires you are totally fine. Also I'm lowered by about 2"" front and rear.

The rear of the car is a tad lighter than the front so performing sharp turns will typically bring the rear around if you are going too fast, however, this is the same as the Dodge Neon in this regard from personal experience.

In order to properly drive in the snow I suggest fully disabling ESC. Hold the button for 5-10 seconds and it will beep and display ESC OFF on the display. This will allow you to spin the tires in the snow and get grip. ESC is way too hindering in the snow and it will certainly get you stuck by cutting too much power. In the rain and dry, ESC works well but it's counter productive in the snow. Believe me.

I would suggest using 15"" steelies with the proper 15"" tires. I've done the math for your here and created a forum thread to show you the sizes and what other people are using.

https://www.fiattech.com/kunena/fiat-500-abarth-wheels-and-tires-discussions/1764-the-ultimate-winter-wheel-tire-thread

I am currently using the 15"" steelies with Antares Grip 60s for this coming winter. The picture I posted looks like the wheel is super close to the caliper. It's close but the photo angle exaggerates it A LOT. I've been through 3 winters and multiple drives during this time back and forth to NS from ON. No issues whatsoever. They clear fine.

If you are not lowered I wouldn't even worry about having any issues. I would suggest though to get Rally Armor mud flaps for the car for winter, it will cut down a LOT of slush/spray on the rear window.
