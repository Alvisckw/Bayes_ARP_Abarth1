If you asked me what the biggest benefit of having this car over something larger, faster, and more comfortable the answer I would give is ""it's the fastest thing on the road in actual traffic"".

Like if the roads are congested but not a full on traffic jam there's probably no better car to be in. Cars pulled over blocking part of the road? Half the time you don't even need to cross the center line to get around. You need several less feet of room to merge. It's pretty light and has good brakes, so you can stop for people jumping into the road easily. It handles well in other emergency conditons. It averages over 30mpg even if you're playing around with it.

It might not be the most comfortable or practical option space wise, but I'd argue daily driving is where it shines the most honestly. Plus I fuck up my back by sleeping anyway so might as well be in pain for a more fun reason.",1679540903.0,2

If you are, it‚Äôs just the Giulia and the Stelvio. Both amazing platforms. One of just a handful of road legal cars with anti-Ackerman steering geometry. It‚Äôs agile like a Ducati on four wheels‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get me wrong, the abarth is amazing too. I had one and still work on them for local enthusiasts. The sound they emit just can‚Äôt be replicated by anything other than an abarth. It sounds as aggressive as their logo looks! And boy are they reliable‚Ä¶ okay, not Toyota reliable, but reliable never the less. I was never left stranded in my abarth, and any mechanical failure was easily fixable, if not, learnable and still manageable with rental tools. 

All in all, from ownership beginning 60k miles, ending in 105k miles:

- broken CV axle (passenger side) $189 in parts to completely rebuild the CV axle and restore it to factory condition. I spent another $189 to buy another rebuild kit for the driver side as preventative maintenance.

- broken wishbone/torque motor mount $59 in parts. These are common to go bad before 100k miles. The more often drivers stabbed the gas, then abruptly let go to hear a ‚Äúpop‚Äù in let‚Äôs say‚Ä¶ 4th gear at 3,000-3,300 rpm‚Äôs, the quicker this specific motor mount would wear.

- Oil cooler gasket - $18 pretty self explanatory. Was doing an oil change, noticed a scary color of oil coming out. Thought my head gasket was gone. Did a compression test. Tested out amazing actually, on average 12 PSI below factory spec. Head gaskets were fine‚Ä¶ how did the coolant get there? Well, this is a common leak point. In the oil cooler. Once you replace it, you‚Äôll notice why.

- shifter cable/linkages $220 lost first and second gear. Road third to get going back home

- lastly, (this was at 102k miles) I did a valve cover gasket overhaul because I noticed a concerning amount oil pooling around and down the side of the block. I replaced: spark plug tube seals, valve cover gasket, PCV O-ring, PCV check valve, and vacuum pump gasket. Hell of a job, like 17 hour job all in one day.


They are fixable. And so long as you maintain them, nothing will just suddenly go out and break on you. You‚Äôll just notice sounds or vibrations or other weird shit and that kinda gives you clues as to where to look. Catch it early enough and you‚Äôre golden. Expect to spend around $500/year on mechanical repairs. Add $600 for preventative maintenance. $300 if you do the work yourself.  $1100 for shop repairs/year. $800 at most for repairs/year if you‚Äôre mechanically inclined.

920,Embaita,jdby0jf,t1_jdasi3d,11ytvfa,"Depending on your budget there's definitely a good amount of options for bigger hot hatches that'll be a bit more comfortable if you want something sporty. I'd say something like a Seat Leon Cupra 280/300 would be one of the better value FWD hot hatches you could buy. 

There's also a VW golf GTD if you're doing a lot of motorway mileage, but if it was me I'd probably take the MPG hit and go petrol. Still I'm not going to act like I have much experience driving other hot hatches, I'd say try to test drive ones that intrest you and are local to you.

I only changed fluids and normal consumables/wear items, and the only problem I ever had was the driver's side door hold-open mechanism get mushy so the door never stayed open.  I had the passenger window break the plastic clip that lets the glass rise and fall, but I think that was more from buffeting wind from a nearby tornado.  It was as reliable as my 2001 Corolla.

Did the rear seat delete and it had a ton of room for store runs. Was 100% a practical daily for me even with Koni yellows/Vogtland springs and an MPx axle-back and I used it as such on my 50ish minute commutes each way at freeway speeds.

Non-engine issues on mine at around 70-80K were the rear wheel bearings failing and one of the front CV axle boots breaking--both common problems.

Now can I answer this question? No. And I am not even sure mfrs of the blankets can. Garrett or someone else is a better choice to refer to bc they have done the thousands of hours and lifetime assessments for their turbos and likely know better than anyone what has an impact.

I'm willing to bet however that a sufficient oil feed with high quality oil and regular changes would have a much larger impact on the lifetime of your turbo than would the blanket. And in all likelihood your turbo can be rebuilt for a fairly reasonable price anyway.

1440,ncc74656m,jakpvhk,t1_jako6w5,11fq39p,"Not to my mind, no. The coolant should be unable to enter the combustion chamber through any passage other than some rupture in the coolant system.

You can do (or ask a mechanic to do) a compression or leakdown test to try to get a handle on where it might be coming from, but any good mechanic will do this as part of diagnosis anyway.

Alternatively, you can also use those testers they sell now to see if there are combustion products in the coolant system. It should (iirc) acidify the coolant if combustion gases are getting into the coolant.

ChrisFix did a video on the last method. (Note, you should definitely not be using the head gasket fix solutions, they do bad things to the engine/coolant system.)

One more tip, if you (or a friend) have an inspection camera (you can also buy USB ones super cheap on eBay) and you can get the plugs out, you can stick it into your cylinders one by one.

Couldn't tell you the difference between a high flow cat's smell and coolant, but I can't imagine they'd smell like that. Coolant, esp from a head gasket, will give you the white smoke, sickly sweet exhaust smell (it's a VERY cloying smell), and it only VERY rarely goes away after warming up.

If you're good with a wrench you can probably do it yourself depending on the way the engine is made and the procedures, I did it on my old Tercel knowing nothing in a weekend, and on an old Civic in a week or two showing a friend how to do it.

1449,ncc74656m,jas1j8m,t1_jaryggg,11fq39p,"You're most welcome! 

I find it terribly unlikely that this would be the cause based on the description of the issues, so I do think you'd just be wasting time and money. I mean it's a $60 part so you wouldn't be losing much but that and 15 minutes, but I really can say with almost total certainty that wouldn't be the fix. This would usually produce a bluish white smoke on startup and wouldn't smell that same sickly sweet.

Rather than deploying the parts cannon, for that price ($150 for an OEM part as you noted elsewhere), you could probably take it to your mechanic or even the stealership and let them have an hour to diagnose it. Hell, if you have a long time or family mechanic, they might even be kind to you and take one look at it and say ""I'd look at the head gasket.""

I can't imagine any reputable mechanic costing you more than a grand to do a simple head gasket swap, because unless you know for a fact you overheated it, or have other reason to suspect a cracked block, there really shouldn't be a very strong need to have the block decked unless it's warped (and a mechanic will check this with a straight edge and feeler gauges when doing the install). For such a small inconsistent leak, I strongly doubt it'll be warped.

The other part to just having a professional diagnosis done: If you drop $100-150 and they do the compression and leakdown tests, and they go ""Yup, bad head gasket and for x and x reasons, nobody can do these for less than 2k, and they always warp the block,"" you KNOW what the issue is and you can just sell it on as a project or beater and someone can take it on knowing that going in.

Start by picking up one of those coolant test kits I mentioned. They'd run you probably $15 max, and if you get a positive result, once more, you know for a fact that it's a head gasket or a block issue, and you can start making plans from there.",1677864351.0,1

I've settled with, and gone through three sets of Continental ExtremeContact Sport summer tires.  Well priced, decently sticky, reasonable life. Unmatched wet performance both in constant wet conditions when I lived in Seattle, and dealing with the instant deluge storm dumps of central Texas. If you live in a very dry area, wet performance won't matter as much. Shoulder profile was pretty rounded so you'd get fairly predictive loss of traction while cornering.

The most likely cause for a climate control fan to intermittently stop working in a Fiat 500 is a faulty blower motor resistor.

The blower motor resistor is an electrical component that regulates the speed of the blower motor. If the resistor is faulty, it can cause the fan to stop working or to work intermittently. This is because the resistor may have difficulty maintaining a consistent electrical connection with the blower motor.

Other possible causes for an intermittent fan could include a loose or corroded electrical connection or a faulty climate control module. However, a faulty blower motor resistor is the most common culprit.",1677209394.0,1

1867,LeTop007,j81wl86,t3_10z692r,10z692r,"I'd say they are equally loud depending on what kind of sound you are looking for. Monza has a thinner sound where the rasp is a bit more pronounced, while the Akrapovic is more bass oriented but still has a nice rasp to it. Both exhausts have a very nice turbo sound coming through them, but the Akrapovic one wins this category because the turbo sound is more present on it than on the Monza. 

My advice is that you go on Youtube and listen to both of those exhausts and figure which you like more. Both of them create a very nice sounding racket, I think that's one of Abarth's biggest stregths - it has the best sounding 4 cylinder engine when you combine it with either of the two exhausts. There is a guy in our neighbourhood with a stock Abarth 595 145 apart from the Akrapovic exhaust, and boy can I hear him coming from some distance away. Also at least once a week a Competizione from a different neighbourhood comes through my street and it is very recognizable from a far. 

I think you can't be dissapointed by either, you just have to pick your favourite. It's tough, but my personal choice would be the Akrapovic since I absolutely adore the amount of turbo sound going through it, it is simply blissful.",1676075837.0,2

1871,LeTop007,j83utbv,t1_j83knfi,10z692r,"I haven't looked into that but my guess would be that they sound pretty similiar in loudness because Abarth somehow managed to dodge the requirement to fit their new vehicles with a gas particulate filter. That usually kills the sound the most but I found on another reddit thread that the 595s do not come with a gas particulate filter so it should be the same. Any sound difference would come in maybe because of differences from the pre-2019 models, but I'd say that downgrading those cars just for a bit of louder sound (if it is even louder just by a bit) would be useless because the 2019+ models are just way better versions of that car, and they still growl like little tigers.",1676121170.0,1

1931,Embaita,j7n3ldh,t3_10wgp3q,10wgp3q,"It's definitely doable, but insurance can change drastically depending on where you live. I'm 20 and I just paid ¬£450 when renewing my insurance for the year. But that's with a ghost immobiliser, living in a quite-ish area and having a HGV licence. Say if you live in the south I imagine it'll cost a fortune considering how often they get stolen.

Other than insurance though it's pretty affordable. I'm paying ¬£13 a month for tax and it gets good mpg figures if you're not thrashing it. The only thing is that oil changes can cost quite a bit, they need doing every 5k miles and the only oil that I'd put in mine is selenia 10w50 which is stupidly priced for 4l of oil.

If I was you I'd maybe get something a bit more boring for a year or 2 until you build your no claims bonus and then get one. You'll probably end up appreciating it a bit more and you'll probably save a bit of money.",1675814663.0,2
1932,Link30567,j7nh6xl,t3_10wgp3q,10wgp3q,"I live in the US, so I know it's not exactly what you're asking and I don't know how different things are there, license/insurance/road quality-wise. My 2013 Abarth is my 3rd car, first was a '99 Camry, which was great as a first car for me to learn on and whatnot. Second one (about 3-4 years later) was a 2013 Camaro. VERY different from the Camry. Way faster and more fun to drive. Camaro engine blew last October and I snagged my current car. Still faster than the Camry but doesn't come close to the acceleration of the Camaro. Assuming, since this is your first car, that you're between the ages of 16-18, I'd say it's probably not a bad choice. Quick enough for someone new to driving, but not so much power you're likely to put it into a wall or something. 

Insurance for me is roughly $200/month with a spotless record, but again, I don't know how things are over there. Road quality is probably 7/10 here for the most part, but when I'm on a bumpy road, MAN do you feel it in the Abarth. If your roads suck, it would still be a fine car, but maybe opt for one with 16"" wheels so you've got more tire sidewall to absorb the bumps.

Maintenance is fine for the most part, oil changes just need to be done more frequently than other cars, and it takes a pretty expensive oil (at least it's expensive here). Gas prices here are about $5/gallon, and the car gets about 30mpg, so there's that, too.

I always admired the Abarth from afar, one of those vehicles we could never have, like the Focus RS (always wanted a MKII RS). If I recall, they did not announce an Abarth for North America immediately, it took some time. 

I remember the day it was announced they would be coming, I called my local (Fiat, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep) dealer and told them I wanted an Abarth as soon as they hit North America. It was the first car I ever purchased brand new. You were able to track the build status of the car, even track its location in shipping after it had been built. As a neat coincidence, I actually took delivery of the car the night before I graduated from College. Not a bad gift for myself. 

That car was a 2012 Nero on red stripes/caps and red leather interior. I went with the 16‚Äù wheels as I had originally planned to upgrade wheels at some point. Never got around to doing that, the only mod I did get done was some Eibach sport line springs and some window tint. A little over a year into my ownership of that car, I had a sudden career change. This change required me to use my vehicle for work, which involved bringing tools/equipment/ladders in my own vehicle with me, so I had to let that car go. I hated the day I sold it, I still miss that very car. 

So this white 2013 Abarth is what I‚Äôve circled back to after all these years. Also on 16‚Äù wheels (the ones pictured are the winter setup) with hopes to upgrade to something different in the future just as with the last car. I ordered Eibach Sportline springs once again because‚Ä¶ you know‚Ä¶ nostalgia or something. I‚Äôve also got a ATP catted downpipe, Sila intake, 4c coils, and a ECU tuner from Tork. So this car is definitely getting the treatment I never had the chance to do the first time around. Looking forward to making this car the Abarth I had sort of dreamed of all those years ago.

2267,BigTurboAbarth,j5m2k1a,t3_10jj2sr,10jj2sr,"Standard transmission clutch plate tops out at 169 ft-lbs of torque. However, as a stock car, your 595 can only produce that much torque at around 4,000 rpm. So long as you‚Äôre not banging off gears (flat foot shifting) and clutch dumping every time you take off, the standard clutch will last up until 210-230 BHP. 

Drivetrain is impressively bulletproof. Intermediate shaft is about 8mm thicker in diameter vs a Honda civic intermediate shaft, for reference. There is also a carrier bearing that ensures intermediate shaft has zero play, even upon launching. Cv axles are also damn near bulletproof. (The rubber on the boot isn‚Äôt!!). 

Had a buddy who tore his cv boot over a year ago. Just got around to replacing it for him in early Jan, and while he did need a new spider gear bearing (and boot), the car was actually driving quite well before we did the repair. Drives like it‚Äôs in a slot now! 

In terms of what you should be preparing for when adding power:

Brakes. More power? You need more brakes. The stock brakes are nearly laughable. With good pads they are much better, but nothing when compared to a BBK from brembo, stoptech, tarox, or willwood to name a few. 

Another extremely important thing to note. Adding power to a car will ALWAYS generate more heat. After all, the *most* efficient ICE‚Äôs will only convert 60% (at best) of the stored energy in petrol/gasoline, to kinetic energy. The other 40% is lost towards heat energy. In a car like the abarth, you‚Äôre looking at converting closer to 30%, with 70% lost towards heat energy. 

My point, you‚Äôll have a LOT of heat. Make sure your intake is drawing air from a cool spot (ideally no filter element inside the engine bay), wrap your exhaust in titanium exhaust wrap, and lastly, look into an upgraded oil pan. Prometeo makes large capacity oil pans that GREATLY help the motor stay lubricated. More oil is more molecules the heat can spread to, meaning oil degradation is slower, and you‚Äôll never have to worry about starving the motor of oil around a turn, because baffles installed in the oil pan keep a perfect amount of oil pooled up around the pick up tube.

That‚Äôs just my .02, I‚Äôm sure there are others who can add a few great tips.",1674516804.0,3

I had a lot of fun with this little demonic street legal go-kart, but I've fallen on hard times lately and might have to part ways with her just to survive until the summer while I try to find a new job or find financing for my new projects.

If anyone lives in Eastern Ontario (the one in Canada) and might be interested in buying my car, you have a month to think about it before I decide to put her up for sale. Do note this car has been in a couple of fender benders with the last owner (one in front, one in back), but the repairs appear to have been done properly. Current mileage is 79,000 km (49,088 miles).

I still have the old CarFax report when I bought it. Most of the maintenance afterwards was done by me and noted in my log book which you'll get with the sale.

Features:

* Deluxe model with auto climate controls, Beats audio, sunroof, leather, digital dash.
* No GPS mount or extra decals.
* Stock engine. No aftermarket parts or mappings.
* Summer stock wheels with some curb rash, wheels repaired last February, tires are Firestone Firehawk Indy 500 205/40R17 XL.
* Includes winter wheels with Pirelli Winter Cinturato 195/45R16 XL.
* No trouble codes or CELs during my ownership.
* Lockable fuel cap.
* Regular oil changes, first with Castrol Edge, now with Pennzoil Platinum Euro.
* Surprisingly little rust for a car driven during the winter.

Mods:

* Cravenspeed short shifter.
* Neuspeed Neu-F rear torsion bar.
* DNA Racing lower subframe brace.
* Corsa Forza vertical chassis braces.
* Corsa Forza strut mount hats (with bearing upgrade).
* Power Stop Euro-Stop OEM-like pads and solid rotors brake kit.
* KYB Excel-G shocks and struts (much smoother ride).
* MOOG anti-sway bar linkages.
* Original braces will be included in the sale. I still have to find the OEM shifter (not recommended -- too sloppy).

Known issues:

* Intermittent coolant leak. It can take a few months before it manifests itself. UV dye has been added to the coolant to track it down. The engine has never overheated.
* Does burn a quart of oil every 3,000 km (1,864 miles), but surprisingly only in Sport mode. Non-sport mode doesn't seem to lose a drop.
* Shifter is a bit stiff and needs to be lubricated.
* Rear fender crack below the fuel filler.
* Side skirts need some TLC. Front right wheel well liner is cracked at the front.
* Tried an aluminum skid plate once, it interacted with the bolts from the Corsa Forza lower subframe brace, causing major seizing problems. Had to cut out the skid plate, outer nuts and bolts. I've reused the OEM bolts with the new subframe brace, and the replacement outer nuts aren't welded to the chassis. Installed a new belly pan.

I noticed when rotating my tires that the inner boots on the drive shafts are both busted and a lot of grease has flown out of the driver's side one (these are inner boots, not CV boots...I don't know what they're actually called).  I feel like the noise and these busted boots might be related...but who knows.

https://www.drive.com.au/news/2021-abarth-595-updated-due-in-australia-second-half-of-this-year/

In the first pic there is a grey car on the left and a blue car on the right. The blue car on the right has the body kit. The grey does not. 

If you keep scrolling, you‚Äôll see a white car. It does not have the body kit.

If you keep scrolling, you‚Äôll see another angle of the blue car from earlier. It does have the body kit. 

Notice the difference? 

Didn‚Äôt think so. 

It‚Äôs basically that the wheel arches are more defined with the body kit. And that‚Äôs it.

There are probably better pictures, but once you see it you‚Äôll be pretty underwhelmed.

Edit: an admittedly awful way of describing it is that it‚Äôs like the wheel arches have ‚Äúeyebrows‚Äù or something with the body kit. Awful analogy, but hopefully it‚Äôll get you looking in the right place.",1671998837.0,2

Any time this occurs it will enter full limp mode and lose all power, and I immediately key cycle it to clear that, it will beep loudly when this happens and cut all power. Tuning is still not complete lol. It is very powerful though.  Have not dyno'd it.",1671131310.0,1

3294,BigTurboAbarth,izziq64,t1_izzfsb4,zkebm9,"Yeah this is detrimental. I‚Äôd be surprised if the multi-air brick didn‚Äôt suffer from this. I‚Äôm sure it caused excess wear. The multi-air brick needs this exact weight to keep hydraulic pressure at the perfect PSI so that your multi-air brick can actuate intake valves. 

Like Peet said, it should be okay for the first few drives, but try not to get the car warmed up totally on your drives, and if you do, please don‚Äôt drive it hard. The weight of oil is (first number for cold weight, and second number for warm weight). By weight I mean viscosity. So 5w-30 has a viscosity of 5 when cold and 30 when warm. 5w-40 has 5 when cold and 40 when warm. This lack of 10 points in viscosity can be adequate enough to starve the multi-air brick of sufficient oil pressure, and cause valve slap (intake valves slapping against pistons, IE, new engine time)

If a shop did this, I‚Äôd be on the phone with a lawyer and going to small claims to have them pay for an engine. This is ridiculous. I‚Äôd be so fucking pissed. That shop should never touch a car again.",1670889966.0,1

Yes, the 250R and a stock dual mass flywheel is good for 300ft lb of torque, but am I really gonna use/need that even with my build, no. 

The engagement window is nearly non existent now. There is almost no way to slip the clutch anymore. If you do get it to slip the way you like, it instantly gets hot and smelly. On engagement, I swear I can feel/hear the dual mass twist way more then stock.

Primed the fuel pump for about 5 seconds before cranking and the engine cranked over immediately and without any sputtering or hesitation at all. Best crank I‚Äôve experienced so far in my short time of ownership. Time to change plugs was under an hour and was stupid easy to do. Plugs on rock auto were $25 total, the NGK ___9IEX ones and gapped them myself to ~0.023/4. 

If you do go ahead and do them yourself, get both a 5/8‚Äù spark plug socket and a 5/8‚Äù deep socket and magnet extender thing. I found that taking the spark plugs out with the deep socket and fishing with a magnet was far easier than getting my spark plug socket stuck in the tube because the plug was seated in there too well and my extension fell off. Just lightly seat the plug in the spark plug socket to install the new plugs and get threads started and then switch to the deep socket for tightening. 

Found some oil in cylinder 2 spark plug tube but the plug was noticeably easier to get out when I took it apart and the coil and tube wall were free of oil when I stuck a towel down the tube. Gonna keep an eye on that and might pop off the coil every now and then to see if it is still leaking in via valve cover gasket or if an improper torque was causing the oil issue.",1669763466.0,1

Some remove the factory air box and plastic piece and just attach a cone filter to the rubber hose like [this.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/a-BIMyg26Dg/maxresdefault.jpg) Some people leave the factory air box on for looks (the big red piece on top), some take it off because with a setup like this it's no longer needed. 

Some wrap around the top/back of the engine and drop down to colder air, like [this](https://500madness.com/image/cache/catalog/Fiat/500/Performance/MAXFlow/Fiat500MAXFlowBraceBarEngineCover5-300x300-4.jpg), where the air box becomes the large cylinder in the middle.

Some others do more goofy stuff, but most are one of those three options.

This Chrysler part number for a cam sensor plug actually fits the v4 light housing, making it almost plug and play. You'll had to figure out which wires to match, you will have 1 extra as the oem v3 tail lights are 5 pin connectors. The v4 is a 4pin connector. 

https://www.tti.com/content/ttiinc/en/apps/part-detail.html?partsNumber=282107-1&mfgShortname=TYC&customerPartNumber=&minQty=5&customerId=

This is the 5pin plug that fits the existing 5pin connector, it does not come with wires, so I unpinned some similar connectors I got off a junkyard random car, and pinned the connector. Little tricky if you've never done that kinda work, but it's not difficult it just requires patience. Make damn sure you silicone the holes around the wires to prevent any issues with corrosion and water intrusion. 

After that, you have two connectors that need wired to make the harness. You match the wires based on the connections on the v4 plate. May take a little trial and error, and in my recollection they aren't wired the same left and right. It's Italian,  go figure. Anyways, you will have.... 

1 ground. 
1 running light
1 brake light
1 turn signal
1 reverse light

V4 tails dont have a reverse light built in, so for the reverse light you can tap the small hole on the v4 housing and insert a 2 wire white led [here](https://i.imgur.com/bREQVN9.jpeg) Make sure you silicone around it to prevent water intrusion. 

You can purchase the center caps [here](https://www.abarthtuning.com/products/genuine-abarth-500-595-series-4-tail-lamp-cover-trim?_pos=2&_psq=tail&_ss=e&_v=1.0) note that you'll order a left and right cap they aren't sold as a pair. 

Hope this helps. I think all in I was about $350usd and a few hours of my time. Bought the lights off amazon for about $130 each. 

Good luck.",1669945653.0,5

So im about to install a pop off filter just to hear the air release. I saw that there is the common well known bmc filter aside from the bonalume filter. I heard that the bonalume should lead to a nicer air release sound but i noticed that its only a plastic cap without any actual filter in it. Will this cause harm to my engine?

I don't sacrifice anything. But considering the role of the pop-of, it's a part that is not important at all. The only detail that matter‚Ä¶ is probably the sound that you can expect from it.   


In details :‚ÄØ

* A pop-of filter replace the tube to the exhaust and release a bit of trashed oil in the atmosphere.
* The filter here just avoid dust if your car in stored outdoor in the desert or something like that.
* You can run without any filter at the location because the turbo will push anything that fall into the little hole in the tube.
* The filter serve no purpose, except to make a bit of boost release sound (that also increase the turbo pressure)

There is no mesh on the bonalube‚Ä¶ so what they call a filter is probably just here to make a bit of sound or avoid a rock inside the tube (but again, your turbo will push anything that enter here.

I'm very good at picking things up when they weren't there before and I feel this way about the noise.

It's very faint and hard to hear because of the injectors but in the video, after the first big rev you can hear the noise as the RPM's drop. If you listen carefully, you can hear it. 

(You can even hear it in the back-ground at start of video before rev)

Side note, I've recently started to smell exhaust when accelerating hard-ish. Could this be a loose bolt in the exhaust header rattling?

Have a friend or S/O hop in the car and hit brakes while you look behind the car. The third brake light (top) is made up of I believe 8 LED nodes, and if one of those is out it will also trip the triangle light.

Besides that, what another poster mentioned is oil change/service due soon.

To reset this light because of a service issue, put the key in and turn to ‚ÄúACC‚Äù then slowly depress the accelerator 3 times all the way down to the floor, within 10 seconds. This resets the oil change light.

from my experience--this is a good side car for fun.  i ended up getting a honda crv for a daily now ;)  i drive the abarth 50 miles per week.

list of shit that i went through:  needed new rear sway bar, door handles fell off, one DRL light is out when lights are off but when the headlights are on both DRL work again, had to rebuild engine head due to burnt valve after 46,500 miles.  ever since that last problem the car has been running fine with my tork tune (hits up to 24 psi too) and on the stock ecu map i only hit 12psi (NO IDEA WHY lol).. so im using it as a weekend car  with the tork tune loaded on the ecu and use the honda as a daily.  you can take your chance on if you get one of the 70% though :P

Once the car passed the safety inspection in Ontario, I fully registered it myself and paid about $240 for new registration, plates, and sticker for one year, plus the Ontario sales tax on the car. The dealer had already collected the federal and Quebec sales tax, then refunded me the Quebec tax since the car was being sold to a resident outside of Quebec.

Last spring, Ontario premier Doug Ford tried to buy our votes by refunding our sticker fees. I got $260 back OF MY OWN MONEY!

I'd do some checking to see if that price is consistent with what other Abarths are going for before spending money. I'd use the missing parts (turbo heat shield, back seats, original shift knob) and the evidence it has been driven hard (the nature of the mods) to negotiate that down a bit if you are set on this one. 

Someone who didn't care enough to keep the missing parts traded that in for a new toy when they got tired of it and now the dealership wants it off their lot for probably three or four times what they gave the owner for it.",1665283274.0,2

In would personally spend some cash on maintenance on the car first, before doing any mods.

It's easy to get carried away (like I do), but it's easy to forget that the health of a car is the most important part, especially when buying used with no real way to tell how it was treated.

Get a nice oil change (oil flush if you have the cash)

New spark plugs (iridium will do nicely)

Replace air filters

Replace pollen filters 

Clean the engine bay and make sure everything is in tip top shape and what might need replacing as preventative maintenance.

I'd personally spend the cash on a remap before worrying about more downforce (abarths have plenty of grips). A good remap company will also tell you if the engine and turbo are healthy during a remap.

Instead, you chose to dismiss my negative experience and tell me I'm wrong because Tork provides support to other people. What a complete lack of professionalism, responsibility, and service.

Tork failed to either meet OR exceed even my lowest expectations.The fact that Tork apparently provides support to paying customers is irrelevant. I received zero response when trying to make a purchase.

I sent direct emails to the email on the ContactUs page ( sales@damnfastdd.com ) as well as messages sent through the ContactUs form at the tork website. I even called and left a detailed voicemail with my full phone number, but didn't receive any followup. All contact attempts were made in June. I regularly monitor my Spam, there was no filtered message.

This wasn't just a single direct email that could have gone to spam. I would understand if my only contact attempt was a single direct email using a burner account that was filtered to  spam, but no response from multiple contact attempts including the site's contact us form?

3. I run about 215hp in mine and haven‚Äôt felt much need to do brakes. I probably will, but if you‚Äôre not doing track work, you probably don‚Äôt need them.

I have run Vogtland coilovers on my Abarth since 2013. I have not compared other kits to stock ride quality, but I feel like they are a good compromise between sporty adjustability, and ride comfort. 

Unless you are fully stripping the car to go racing only, you do not need a Willwood/Brembo kit. Simply get an upgraded set of front and/or rear rotors, and a good set of pads. I have been running Zimmerman Z-Coat front rotors w/ EBC red pads. I am still running the stock rear pads and rotors from 2012, original never replaced.  Our cars do almost no braking in the rear, so they are less important to upgrade. 

One note on brakes. I highly recommend a braided brake line kit. Removes the ‚Äúflex‚Äù/squishy feel of a stock brake kit and makes it feel like you have a much more expensive brake upgrade on stock brakes.",1663548547.0,3

The throw out bearing is what pushes against the pressure plate when you disengage the clutch. It's a $250 wear and tear part, but you still need to remove the transmission to replace it. 

The fact that the noise disappears when you press the clutch pedal leads me to believe it's the throw out bearing. When the clutch pedal is released, the throwout bearing has little to no load on it, and if it's worn, it will rattle. The rattle goes away when you press the clutch pedal because there's pressure on both sides of the bearing. 

If there I/O bearing were the problem, you would probably hear the noise constantly because the forces on the bearing don't change significantly with clutch engagement.

Summary: I make the mistakes so you don‚Äôt have to.. decided to  
gamble and mod my diffuser. not perfect but I like it. Total cost 100 bucks..  
can be cheaper with other products or if you just want the fins or lights individually.  
¬†  
Install notes:  
I used truck bedliner spray on the finished product.. covers  
any scratch and mistakes plus I have most of my car already sprayed with the  
crap. The brake light shows up with a white lens and you pick which ¬†color leds you want in it when you order.¬† I wanted it red so I decided to use red tint  
spray to tint mine red.. use a Dremel or a spork to punch a 3x3 hole in the  
mesh of the diffuser.. provided light brackets hold it in place very well  
because they sandwich together the plastic around it.. took out driver side  
rear tail light.. spliced into black for ground and white/green for brake  
light.. NOW plug in the taillight to test the connection.. wiring can be  
perfect but the light will NOT engage if the taillight assembly is not plugged  
in‚Ä¶after that route and wire loom the cable.. use zip ties.. hot exhaust pipes  
will melt it all if you do not wire manage the connection. After that bob‚Äôs  
your uncle..all done

Parts used: There are the product I picked. was looking at  
others but they seemed the most painless

At least that was what I was told by someone with 215s on OEM 17s. I have aftermarket 17s but they are OEM sized. It had Nittos when I got the car. One had damage and went flat. No replacements in Arizona. So all the tires got replaced with Kuhmos. I had already been looking to replace all the tires before the flat anyway. The Nittos would make sense on a track that was dead smooth. Way too harsh for the steets with bumps and cracks and grooves. You really do know the car is using drive by wire steering with those Nittos. Car danced around constantly with zero input on the wheel. It kept going straight, mostly. With the Kuhmos the ride is softer because i didnt need 180 mph rated tires. So a softer tire compound and more forgiving sidewall has done wonders for the ride.

I think it really comes down to looks. If you want 17s, get 17s. Also bear in mind that if you've got 16s at the moment, you won't have the Eibach lowering springs. So if looks are a factor then bear that in mind too.",1662356039.0,1

5587,volttage,imr04av,t3_x3bytx,x3bytx,"I posted this 2 weeks ago, but I‚Äôll repost here:

I am currently replacing the engine on my 2012 Abarth. I ordered a new long block from FCA. It took 4 months to get.

They are still being made. At the time I placed my order, there were 9 orders nationwide. 

Be advised that the long block part number is substituted from a short block part number for our 5mt only Abarths. This means the long block you get from FCA is for the AT version of the Abarth, and will have differences, most notably, the flywheel will be wrong, there will be a different rear main seal cover, it will have a reluctor wheel behind the AT flywheel that you do have to use with the correct MT flywheel, the front engine mount bracket will be wrong and need to be changed over from your MT block, along with both the upper and lower timing belt covers.  The timing belt tensioner will look completely different from the MT version from ‚Äò12 / 13‚Äô. 

The engine is a bare long block, meaning no turbo, no intake manifold, no oil filter housing/cooler, no vacuum pump, no thermostat, and no oil or coolant lines for the turbo, also no main water pump pipe. Budget/bare that in mind when you decide to buy new or mileage engine.

I have yet to start the engine, but it is back in the vehicle. I am being held up by FCA not being able to supply me with the correct A/C discharge line. 

If anyone has any questions about the removal or install, I can probably answer them.

Tldr: the new engine you would get from FCA is for an automatic, so a used LKQ complete engine will be the same, but could come with some automatic parts on it. If the project chassis is manual, make sure you take accurate stock of what is on it and needs transferring/replacing on the Auto donor engine.",1662087898.0,2

They are still being made. At the time I placed my order, there were 9 orders nationwide. 

Be advised that the long block part number is substituted from a short block part number for our 5mt only Abarths. This means the long block you get from FCA is for the AT version of the Abarth, and will have differences, most notably, the flywheel will be wrong, there will be a different rear main seal cover, it will have a reluctor wheel behind the AT flywheel that you do have to use with the correct MT flywheel, the front engine mount bracket will be wrong and need to be changed over from your MT block, along with both the upper and lower timing belt covers.  The timing belt tensioner will look completely different from the MT version from ‚Äò12 / 13‚Äô. 

The engine is a bare long block, meaning no turbo, no intake manifold, no oil filter housing/cooler, no vacuum pump, no thermostat, and no oil or coolant lines for the turbo, also no main water pump pipe. Budget/bare that in mind when you decide to buy new or mileage engine.

You‚Äôre probably loosing 3 quarts of oil every 6-7k (tuned engines have more oil blow by and therefore burn much more oil)

Filter should be replaced every 25k miles. 

I‚Äôd say change the filter and change oil, lower your intervals down to 5k MAX‚Ä¶ you have a tuned car, there‚Äôs no way you should be waiting that long as your oil will degrade much quicker than on stock cars.

Edit: back to the oil loss. If you have insufficient oil level, your multi air brick will crap out constantly. It NEEDS at least 3 quarts to completely cover the oil pickup tube, and to properly lubricate the multi-air brick. Anything less and you start sending air through the oil pickup tube when making a sharp turn.

Also, your multi-air filter will become clogged way faster if you wait this long between oil changes.

Carefully pull the plastic retaining strip out of the channel starting at either end. The ends of the retaining strip have cuts to allow it to contour into place. Be careful at the ends to not break or tear the plastic here because it is not as strong here. Pull straight out as close to the plastic retaining strip as possible.

I think it may be to allow water drainage through the spoiler and the foam/rubber bit may help deflect water towards the spoiler drain areas. I'll test that this weekend I think. The foam/rubber may also give some cushion against the top when folded down against the spoiler.

Also, CV boots tend to rip so make sure to check them to see if they need replacing. Once you own one you should check the boots regularly as well. Rule of thumb I have found is try to find the best example you can afford as it will save you in the long run. These cars require some regular and preventative maintenance but if you take car of her, she will take care of you. 

With regard to the upgrades you are off to a good start with your list. The 4c coil packs and plugs I would do immediately. It makes the car come alive imo. A short shifter is also a much needed mod. 

I would focus primarily on suspension mods to start if you plan on autocrossing it. If it's only going to be a track day car, I would put coilovers. But, if you plan on driving it on roads as  well I would go with Koni yellows and lowering springs. The ride is way better and still much better than stock. Couple this with sway bars and chassis braces.  I went with DNA racing and would highly recommend their products. Especially the front strut tower bar, rear torsion bar and camber plates. 

I would also consider a rear seat delete, harness bar and racing harness to keep you in your seat and provide some extra chassis rigidity from the harness bar. I went with the Cipher racing one. 

Since you are in Texas, I would recommend mods to help with heat soak issues for your engine as the first place to start. These would be a fenderwell intake, front mount intercooler (fmic), turbo blanket and silicone radiator hoses. For the fmic and fenderwell intake, I've got ATM.

At this point the car would be ready for a downpipe and a tune. Hope this helps.",1660610148.0,2

6532,mcmercf1,iilq76d,t3_we0t4x,we0t4x,">P0299-TURBOCHARGER UNDERBOOST CONDITION  
Theory of Operation  
The base Turbocharger boost pressure is managed by the mechanical   
Wastegate. The Wastegate is a mechanical valve that, when opened, allows  
 exhaust gases to flow around the turbine. The Wastegate is spring   
loaded in the closed position. Boost pressure is applied to a diaphragm   
that works against the spring pressure of the Wastegate. When the force   
created by the boost pressure exceeds the spring force in the Wastegate,  
 the valve opens. This limits boost pressure by limiting the speed of   
the Turbocharger. Boost pressure is applied against the spring pressure   
of the Wastegate to control the speed of the Turbocharger. The Wastegate  
 Solenoid is Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) by the PCM and is located   
between the compressor and mechanical Wastegate. When opened by the PCM,  
 the Wastegate Solenoid bleeds boost pressure away from the mechanical   
wastegate, this allows the PCM to increase boost pressure to a level   
higher than would be allowed by the mechanical wastegate alone. The   
system operates as follows; boost pressure is supplied to the Wastegate   
Solenoid through a hose connected to the compressor side of the   
Turbocharger. The Powertrain Control Module (PCM) varies the PWM signal   
to the Wastegate Solenoid to control the amount of boost pressure   
applied against the Wastegate. When more boost pressure is needed, the   
Wastegate Solenoid will direct more of the boost pressure to the clean   
air tube upstream of the Turbocharger and less against the Wastegate   
spring.  
When Monitored:  
With the engine running and DTCs P0033, P0034, P0035, P0237, P0238,   
P0299, P006C, P006D, P012B, P1185, P2261, P2262 are not present.  
Set Condition:  
The PCM detects that the difference between the Boost Pressure Sensor   
desired value minus the actual reading is above a calibrated value for   
the driving conditions.  
Possible Causes   
RESTRICTED AIR FILTER   
BOOST SYSTEM PRESSURE HOSES RESTRICTED OR LEAKING   
SMALL INTAKE SYSTEM LEAK OR RESTRICTION   
EXHAUST SYSTEM RESTRICTION   
WASTEGATE SOLENOID

The proper way to check your oil is five minutes after you turn the engine off. I usually do it at gas stations after filling the tank.

- Pull dipstick out,
- Wipe clean with a CLEAN cloth or towel,
- Put dipstick back in FULLY,
- Pull dipstick out,
- Check the oil level on the stick.

If you don't wipe the dipstick, you'll be seeing the oil that splashed on the dipstick while the engine was running. You won't get a true reading of the oil level.

With that said, hearing that the dipstick was dry at one point in time is NOT reassuring! It should NEVER be dry even with a cold engine! That means you're down AT LEAST a quart of oil!",1659300350.0,5

If you had your oil change done at a shop, chances are they screwed up somewhere. If not, check for a bad gaskets on the drain plug and oil filter housing, and check for cracks on the housing itself.

6692,Slayer7_62,ihsap64,t3_w8uuax,w8uuax,"I would argue it depends on your life‚Äôs needs. It‚Äôs definitely a far more enjoyable car but you‚Äôre losing practicality, fuel economy & potentially some reliability. As a commuter car the suspension is definitely stiff but not to the point of being punishing, and the seating position I wouldn‚Äôt say is super comfortable. 

I have a crossover SUV for family duty or whenever I need to actually haul something or go long distance. The Abarth is my fun daily. I would have gone for a Miata but wanted to have the capability to bring my son somewhere if needed, and he‚Äôs too young for the front seat. While I never intend on using it for family duty, the ability to use it for bringing my family somewhere if needed is a bonus. Compared to a Miata you‚Äôre sacrificing rear wheel drive & a convertible but have a far more practical car. If you don‚Äôt need the rear seats, you can have decent cargo room if you take their headrests off and fold them down. I usually have my son‚Äôs booster seat inside so I am a little limited in that regard, but realistically I can carry a good amount of groceries still with that seat there, and otherwise at max have maybe a backpack or two. Size wise, my 6‚Äô6‚Äù fishing pole literally fits, but if I don‚Äôt disassemble it it will run from the end of the tailgate, through the split between rear seats and rest against the dash. If I fold the passenger side rear seat down and put the passenger seat all the way forward I can /barely/ fit a double rifle case. You can fit a couple of the bigger plastic tote bins if you‚Äôre creative and have the seats folded down. 

You can easily just grab an aftermarket system for the car, whether that‚Äôs a independent unit you put somewhere or replace the stock unit. I personally just use my phone, sure I don‚Äôt have service on most of the better driving roads in the mountains near me, but I keep a couple road atlases in the car with me and know the roads decently well. I certainly wouldn‚Äôt base a decision on a car on the infotainment or you‚Äôll almost never be happy. 

TLDR: Amazingly fun car, don‚Äôt worry about the lack of Nav unless you absolutely need it & can‚Äôt use a phone instead for navigation. The car is far less practical with worse fuel economy, but if you care for driving is a great option. A Miata is arguably a better driver‚Äôs car but less practical. For an only car I‚Äôd go for an Abarth, since a Miata really will struggle for general use while you /can/ make a 500 work for it.",1658880028.0,1

If I would have kept it through the winter I would've replaced the timing belt, water pump, changed trans fluid, replaced the 2 dead tpms sensors, and fixed the rear spoiler (hairline crack). Which would've been another   ~$400

I did blow some cash on bolt on mods and an OFT. But the fun factor was worth the ~$1200

Replacement parts and fluids aren't cheap for this car. Plugs are ~$13/ea, 5w-40 euro spec is like $35 5qt, coil packs are ~$45, tires weren't bad pricewise but a less commonly stocked size which sucks if you have to wait for a replacement to get trucked in (might've been partially covid/supply chain related).

I‚Äôm not really familiar with the 595 or any of the European models, but depending on how aggressive it actually is it might just be the limiter.

You should probably do as some of the other comments have mentioned and check your spark plugs and replace your ignition coils, if those things start to go then your car can have a similar reaction when hitting high boost.

But, here‚Äôs some of the things people don‚Äôt know about credit card insurance:
-Only valid if one driver
-Only valid outside of parking lots
-Only valid below 55mph
-Only valid if between the hours of 6am-10pm
-Only valid if credit card being used for payment of the rental car has rental coverage

And much more. These are generalized, as they are just some I remember off the top of my head from several different credit card companies: (AMEX,MC,VISA,DISC)

So, now that the boring is out of the way, this dude declines rental coverage, and car comes back like [this.](https://imgur.com/a/eEhFdx1)

I make a quick video about it, then approach the customer, bringing him outside to see the damage. Two dents on the hatch, scratched up bumper, broken rear wiper. I said ‚Äúmy friend, you know this doesn‚Äôt look too good, right?‚Äù To which he replied:

‚ÄúWatchu mean, y‚Äôall never do a walk around, that‚Äôs been there since you rented it!‚Äù

So I brought out my intern from inside the office, (my coworker who rented the car) and then we continued the discussion, with my first question being:

‚ÄúHey Brian, this is Mr.Johnson, you rented him the dark blue Chevy equinox, do you remember doing a walk around? And if so, did you see any of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúEhhhh‚Ä¶ errrmmm‚Ä¶ yeaaaahhhh that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a lot of damage‚Ä¶‚Äù I damn near let loose with laughter, but still kept contained. Man I love that intern. 

So, (I do this trick a lot) I ask him if he was in any crowded parking lots, he said yea, I said ‚Äúman you know that‚Äôs like the #1 spot for hit and runs rights? You probably got hit by some truck that tried to back into a spot‚Äù. (This trick puts the blame on somebody else because a lot of people will never own up to it)

Now, guy says he will use his credit card insurance. Remember, he declined protections and opted to use his credit card protection.

Credit card of his didn‚Äôt protect accidents in parking lots.

Compression

Injectors

You still haven't said what country you are in so I am going to assume not NA so you don't have a multiair engine.  That means it is unlikely to be compression, but it may be worth running a compression test anyway just to be on the safe side.

You know how when you rip in 1st and hit second how the car kinda drops power and then sort of bumps back up in power once you‚Äôve been in 2nd for a couple seconds? It no longer does that, it acts like a normal car, 1st builds boost quicker and will spin the tires halfway up your pull and then when you hit second it spins a bit and stays consistent in the power band and keeps pulling rather than that annoying bog when you first hit second gear. And the power continues all the way to the rev limiter, it pulls its hardest all the way to 6500 rather than dropping off around 5300rpm, which makes the car a considerable amount faster. I noticed I didn‚Äôt feel a huge power gain, but then again it‚Äôs hot as shit lately. I did take it out at night and it was pretty drastic, but not feeling it doesn‚Äôt correlate with how fast the car is going, it‚Äôs like my bum doesn‚Äôt feel the difference but the speedo says otherwise. Before I‚Äôd be hard on it ripping as fast as I could and I‚Äôd let off thinking I was doing around 130kmh as usual but the Speedo says 165. So my bum might not feel it but the speedo sees it, it creeps up the speedo a lot faster than it feels so I‚Äôd say it probably bumped it up 25-35whp, feels like it‚Äôs probably around 200whp.

Couple of weeks ago I finally found my boost leak. There was a hole in one of my stock intercoolers. Fine. 

Bought a front mount from Madness. Installed it, all is good. 

Take it out for the first drive and the boost fluctuates wildly at WOT. It'll go from 21psi (mechanical guage) to 15 to 20 to 17) over and over. My car has a high flow downpipe so you can hear the wastegate being opened and closed while it does. 

Annoying, but I figure it's the wastegate solenoid because the car is a 2013 with almost 100k miles. So I order a new one, replace it, and there is a small tear in one of the boots on my old one, so I figure that was the problem. Drive it for a day and it felt mostly fine, though it did overboost a few times by a couple of psi, it didn't go crazy pulling it back. It would spike 20 or so, pull it back to 18, and hold. 

Yay!... Or not...

After another drive, I noticed it do the boost fluctuation just once. So I reset the ECU by unhooking the battery for hours. Put it back together and it was just as before, mostly fine with some spikes to 20, but nothing crazy, again. 

Yay! Again! Or not... Again!

Tonight I took it out onto the interstate (in Mexico) to really run through the gears. The video clip is from tonight. 

The first clip is right after I pulled onto the highway, the second is maybe a minute later. 

Now it's intermittent. Some pulls it fluctuates, some pulls it holds right at 18, some pulls it over boosted then pulled it back in. Tonight is also when I noticed that the factory boost gauge, at times, is showing something like 22psi. My mechanical gauge isn't agreeing. 

So I'm at a loss. I need help. I've dumped so much money into this car and it's killing me. I just want it to be right. 

The car is a 2013, manual, Multiair with 99k ish miles. 

It has a 500Madness front mount, ATP high flow downpipe, Sila short ram intake, and Turbosmart Wastegate actuator, adjusted to 2mm preload.  I did the diy version of the EC boost leak fix, and other than that the car is stock. I don't believe it was tuned as the ECU appears stock, and the previous owner seemed cheap/lazy. 

The only thing left really is either the TS wastegate is faulty, or the turbo is faulty. I can't afford a turbo right now, or an actuator for that matter, but if we all agree it's the actuator maybe I can rebuild it?

I don't know.

To me that sounds like a switch would certainly power the device on/off, but no more than just that. I believe the Bluetooth receiver inside the throttle commander still needs an active connection with your phone, so an on/off might not cut it. 

I haven‚Äôt messed with any of the throttle commanders, I‚Äôm really just going off intuition and what was described in the post.

I do have a question, what benefits drew you towards purchasing the throttle commander? AFAIK, they just remap 50% throttle to be 100% throttle on sport, or remap 100% throttle to be 50% throttle on eco, or something along the lines. I guess I just don‚Äôt see the benefit of the pedal commander VS just mashing the gas pedal lol. Or not mashing it if you want fuel economy.

I had a similar issue with my E38, where it would wobble quite violently whilst accelerating and whilst up to motorway speeds around 55-75mph. I had the car full mechanically checked over (22 years old with 210,000 miles on it) and I was told it was mechanically perfect, and they couldn't find anything. Good news, but didn't help!

I had the wheels balanced 5 times by multiple garages and I had the wheels aligned too, issue was still there. So, the last thing I could think of was to change my tyres, although they 'were absolutely fine'. Visually, you couldn't see anything wrong with them, and as I said, they'd been balanced 5 times.

Anyway, ¬£700 on 4 new tyres and my wobbling went away! It was the actual tyres themselves, they only had 11,000 miles on them but something must have happened to have caused this.

I suspected CV joints (boots were torn). Found that when I removed the axles the inside bearings came apart, leaving the bearing ‚Äúbaskets‚Äù attached to the transaxle. 

Long story short: the bearing can wear a groove into that bearing basket. At certain speeds (and under power) the bearing will begin to dance in and out of that groove introducing one hell of a shutter in the front end.

The same mass of air is at a lower pressure in a given volume if it's colder. Think about how your tire pressure goes up after you get them warm, it's the same deal.

There‚Äôs quite a few different avenues for short shifters on our abarths, and they really all represent the same thing: you get what you paid for. 

There are ‚Äúshort shifter adapter/kits‚Äù that are between $100-$300, and some of them are highly rated. To mention a few,

- [cravenspeed short shifter](https://www.speedmotive.com/select-make/fiat/2012-abarth-north-american-model/abarth-performance/abarth-short-shifters/fiat-500-abarth-cravenspeed-short-shifter-kit)

And there are also full short shifter assemblies, like the:

- [AAD short shifter kit](https://www.speedmotive.com/select-make/fiat/2012-abarth-north-american-model/abarth-performance/abarth-short-shifters/fiat-500-abarth-all-angles-design-short-shifter)

Edit: Cravenspeed is, from what I‚Äôve heard on this forum, the perfect balance between price and performance.

7882,BandiTToZ,ibethyr,t3_v6b1mk,v6b1mk,"Based on my research the only intake worth doing is a front fenderwell intake, but you need to pair that with a front mount intercooler. Those 2 items will take you over $1000. Any other intake is purely for sound as there is no power gain that is even remotely noticeable imo. 

I would start with the Alpha Romeo 4c coil packs and a set of ngk iridium spark plugs. This will make the car feel like it's in sport mode went it isn't and was a noticeable improvement when in sport mode. Plugs and coil packs should run about. This would run you about $300-400. 

I would also consider adjusting the wastegate back to factory specification. Mine was off by a few mm and it made a big difference once I reset it. Extra bonus is this is a free upgrade and only requires your time, effort and access to some pretty basic tools.

With the rest of the money, I would invest in either new rubber for the rims or better brake pads, rotors, stainless steel brake lines and fluid. Brakes should run about $500-700. Rubber would probably be more for a good grippy set and may take you over $1000 depending on what you get.

A tune would only be necessary, to my understanding, once you have the following:
Front mount intercooler
Front fenderwell intake

Downpipe

>You dont need big brakes for the occasional run out in the backroads / Big brakes are a waste on a 2500lb car on the street. 

Uh. Maybe for you it's not needed. That depend of how you drive it, where, and the duration of the session. I don't drive this car as daily but all the time to toge in the local mountains, very aggressively. I can toast oem brakes in a question of minutes or maybe with 10 km of downhill curvy road.  
If I tried 5 setups before reaching satisfaction, there is probably a reason. And I am not the craziest one of my friends. I am pretty sure that many people have higher requirements than theses 1 piston piston callipers and disk size that are very cheap.  
I tried 3 types of pads / disc and brakes lines before swaping to bigger brakes and it resulted into the same fading even with pads / discs that are used for rally racing.  
On paper, it's supposed to lower the risk of destroying pads / fading. But in reality, with you can chose whatever high ends component as you prefer, EBC yellow stuff or better, DS2500, HP2000, Xtra, RBF700, I got no difference at all. Size matter.  


>The stock pads and rotors get hot and stop working sooner than better cross-drilled/slotted rotors.

Drilled / slotted rotors is not a feature designed to cool brakes but to get more friction and brake performance. The fun part is that cross drilled / slotted will give you more friction‚Ä¶ and higher temp (Even if that difference will probably very small, for sure). Brembo or Brembo XTRA, or Tarox are often made with the same type of material quality. You just need better discs when you warp them, and with a Abarth it's quite impossible considering the weight of it. The only part when you want to push the quality are pads. You can toast them at the same speed whatever the disc you're choosing (except maybe with floating 2 pieces dics that have aluminium boil and that are often lighter and thinner).

Again, I suggest to not spend money on performance pads and discs with standard brakes calliper / discs size, except if you just have to change them and just want a replacement. To me that a Waste of money. I don't want other people to do the same.",1654711410.0,1

Also, be prepared for snow, in Alberta.  As another poster said, you'd be generally alright if you get a second set of wheels with good winter tires.

Lastly, you should consider practicality.  While there's no problem with the North American version on the highways, there's something to be said about a larger car for longer distance driving.

The plate needs to be secured using two of the brace's bolts, and the paint on the brace is delaminating where it comes into contact with the plate.

To make matters worse, the brace uses hex bit countersunk bolts instead of the regular OEM flange bolts with a nice protruding standard socket head. I've already partially stripped the heads of two of the countersunk bolts while trying to remove them and will need the help of a pro to work out how to completely remove the bolts without any of them getting stuck.

Once that's done, I'll replace the Corsa Forza brace with a DNA Racing brace that's engineered to use the OEM bolts, and I'll replace the skid plate with the OEM belly pan. I need to put the plate aside for now because I suspect it's catching the wind while on the highway and vibrating like crazy. The belly pan will confirm this.

Yes certainly could be an earth issue somewhere, and if movement is causing it then maybe once I tow it and things move around it may start again?
It could be an immobiliser issue? I had a similar issue back in March, but we put it down to a dead battery as I hadn't started the car for 2 weeks and then tried replacing some fuses (which exacerbated the issue at the time) so the key had to be reprogrammed.

Also, do you top off gas or just throw a dollar amount in every now and again? To build pressure in the gas tank (enough to trigger EVAP purge) you need to fill the tank to the point where the fill nozzle clicks as it‚Äôs done topping off. 

If you have been practicing both of these steps, then take a look under the rear of your abarth. Slightly past where the axle back is located (suitcase muffler for older abarth examples), you will see a black box. It‚Äôs a charcoal canister, mounted to the underside of the chassis. See if any connections/the canister itself is damp. Very likely gasoline.

They don't specialise in any particular vehicle. I've been looking at options myself for months now and JF Automotive seem by far the most clued-up. Their customer service is good too, they've always been quick to respond.

Most importantly, they can carry out a live map rather than just the flash-map/tuning box that you'll get from TDI. And there's not much difference in the price.

Hope that helps buddy.

The only advantages really ( and obviously ) is you get a nice open air feeling. The second and best thing about the cabrio is you can really hear that beautiful exhaust sound when the roof is fully open.

I did not that the 2013 had actual guage needles rather than digital guages, not sure how those hold up. At the same time it doesn't have heated seats (nice to have but not important) and the passenger seat not having an armrest is rather funny.

The Comp is not just a ¬´‚ÄØsport finish‚ÄØ¬ª. When it comes to daily drive it, and not like a madman (or madgirl, in this case), theses feature will provide more issues than pros. Comfort leather seats look's good, open dif is better for most people, less dangerous, and standards brakes (that can brake quite well, even when we talk about Endurance) are sufficient.

A major thing to note, if you drive the car hard, you‚Äôll notice lots of lift-off-oversteer and a much looser feeling rear end.

8790,BandiTToZ,i5i541n,t3_u80s09,u80s09,"I'm from Canada but did some similar work myself so maybe I can offer some perspective.  All my prices are CAD you would need to convert to USD. The spark plugs were about $80 or so and the labour took about 1.5 hours roughly. I'm sure a shop can get it done in an hour. Oil and filter cost about $90 for the material. I used a fram filter and Liqui Moly oil, only the best for my baby haha! The labour took about 45-60 minutes. I have an oil extractor so I didn't need to lift the car, everything was done from the engine bay. 

Based on the price you were quoted, I don't think you are overpaying, but you can do this work yourself to save some money. The parts tend to be on the pricier side, but still not crazy like some cars I've owned in the past. 

The work itself is not too difficult and can be done with a pretty simple tool set. There's a lot of great tutorial videos on YouTube as well which is where I learned to work on mine.

8791,BigTurboAbarth,i5ipza0,t3_u80s09,u80s09,"The abarth is a *pretty* good platform to learn service on. For the most part. 

$150 for plugs, you could save $110 and do them yourself. Takes about 30 minutes if you were learning and doing it for your first time (given you have the right tools)

Cabin air filter: kind of a bitch to do, but honestly not all that bad if you have patience. The filter itself is probably $15.

And $80-$120 is what I‚Äôve been seeing for dealership/service center oil changes. Mopar dealership charges like $13/quart too. 

The oil filter is probably the worst part about doing an oil change on this car. But still, no more than an hour to do for someone doing it for their first time. I pay around $40 for my oil change. 4 quarts synthetic rotella T-6, STP extended life oil filter, new drain plug.

Super easy and I highly recommend you do it if you can. $15 CAD per plug for factory spec NGKs from clubplug.ca. (Again, highly recommend).
