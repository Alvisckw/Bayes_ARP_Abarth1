0,Fireid518,jtpd84d,t3_15b5yln,15b5yln,"My 13 sport was having an issue where it would stutter on launch, it would not idle constantly, and acceleration was choppy (I don't know how else to explain it, it would not accelerate smoothly). It drove a lot better in sport mode.

I cleaned the injectors, ran premium fuel, replaced the fuel filter, checked and re-gapped the plugs, replaced the maf sensor, and cleaned the throttle body. Nothing helped.

I ended up replacing the accelerator petal, the potentiometer in the petal had gone bad, it solved all my issues.",1690485848,1
1,TechXPlays,jtq63k4,t1_jtpd84d,15b5yln,"I had my battery checked today... sometimes it might be the simple things. The amps were fine, the voltage was not. Could explain why in sport it was fine, in normal it wasn't. Supposedly (and this feels true) sport mode ""unlocks"" around 20 tq in the abarth. That could cause better charging from the alternator? That was my only guess around it",1690496788,1

3,Dexter713_dfn,jtxarlx,t1_jtq63k4,15b5yln,Honestly a dying battery or poor connection on the terminals or any of the grounding wires seems to cause a host of random issues that would normally be attributed to something else mechanically wrong. So my first suggestion for any unexplainable issues on 500s is to get the battery checked and check all the connections. 9 times out of 10 it that seems to fix the issue or at least eliminate other variables that may be causing multiple issues to be harder to diagnose.,1690626747,1
4,turneyde,jttzbn0,t1_jttk5c2,15b5yln,Well thank you drknowsitall,1690566247,0
5,TechXPlays,ju0uk32,t1_jtxarlx,15b5yln,"Unfortunately, it wasn't the battery. I was driving it yesterday on the high way, cruise control 65mph, and after about 10 minutes on cruise, it misfired. I cancelled cruise control, lowered to 60 and was fine for another 30 minutes.  


It has always seemed like ""above a certain RPM, there's an issue"" because it'll do it in 4th at 45 since that's above around 2700, it'll do it in 3rd around 2800, etc",1690683232,1
6,MrWelvas,jpu5uqa,t3_14kncb5,14kncb5,Is that an abarth or the normal version? It honestly seems too simple to be the abarth lol,1687946307,1
7,Live-Variation8684,jpvbe96,t1_jpu5uqa,14kncb5,Had to check myself but it has the scorpions on the wheels and Abarth badging on the bonnet and boot lid,1687966989,2
8,MrWelvas,jpvc1n8,t1_jpvbe96,14kncb5,Maybe its just a base model Abarth then... interesting. I've never seen one like this.,1687967243,2
9,Live-Variation8684,jpvy8uy,t1_jpvc1n8,14kncb5,Potentially. Very cool nevertheless,1687975600,2
10,MrWelvas,jpvz3ti,t1_jpvy8uy,14kncb5,Agreed!,1687975928,2
11,OkTerm3057,jmv1moc,t3_140a0t0,140a0t0,"It sounds like the amplifier has failed, and if the subwoofer has never worked that could also be a sign. 

I wonder if mute could be stuck on?",1685886257,1
12,wi11iam-b,jmynbi6,t1_jmv1moc,140a0t0,Hi thanks for the reply. Would that be built into the radio or an external part?,1685949856,1
13,OkTerm3057,jmypli6,t1_jmynbi6,140a0t0,"Built into the radio. Have you considered an aftermarket radio? At this point it might be worth replacing it, it could be repaired but finding the fault could be costly.",1685951837,1
14,wi11iam-b,jn0k5sy,t1_jmypli6,140a0t0,Looks like it?€?ll have to be replaced. Thanks for your help.,1685987026,1
15,OkTerm3057,jn19tbv,t1_jn0k5sy,140a0t0,"You could see if there is a line out, I assume the sub uses a line out, if that worked you could hook up an external amplifier.",1685997936,1
16,GWBoes,jks3ovr,t3_13lxmeh,13lxmeh,"In the bin since it's not an Abarth :)
But originally on this car it should be where the 6 speed logo is, but if I look at that emblem it's also to big.",1684508588,11
17,tatwftw,jks9h1g,t1_jks3ovr,13lxmeh,"Well, I know it's not the original abarth version but I liked the logo. That doesn't make me a criminal. I don't see the problem to put the insignia as it is not that far of being an abarth. Anyway, thanks for your opinion.",1684510786,0
18,GWBoes,jksk4n9,t1_jks9h1g,13lxmeh,"Just messing with you.  I also ran a big Abarth sticker on my first car (96 Bravo 1.6), mainly to hide the remains of an old country sticker. 
You could also place it off centre below the Stilo emblem like they did on the first series, in your case between the s and t.",1684514793,2
