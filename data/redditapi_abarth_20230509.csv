1,500 series re-fueling fix,Niff_Naff,"So I started experiencing issues with my 595 Abarth where I'd go to put fuel in and the pump would instantly stop. I could see as I was filling, that bubbles were creeping to the fuel nozzle which causes it to stop pumping. 

A couple of forum posts suggested taking the back bench off and tapping the fuel pump lightly as the rollover valve can get stuck and cause this behaviour. I did this AND IT WORKED! I figured I would share on here because it seems to be a common issue with the 500 series Abarth's and I'm actually astounded it worked! 

Has saved me a trip to the dealer and probably a lot of money too. I'm not too fussed if I have to do it every now and then because it's a 10 minute job with the right tools.",9,12,0,12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/139ruhg/500_series_refueling_fix/,1683384351.0,139ruhg

I even drove a GIULIA QV a dream car of mine and I loved it. As a Alfa fan tough nothing could compare to the Abarth.
So I was wondering if I could get a first gen ( so to call it a 2008-2012 ) Abarth for around 10-15k ? There some cheaper at around 7-8k but very few. 
Anything to lookout for and are they problematic cars ?
As far as I know the regular fiats that recieved the 1.4 T-jet like the grande Puntos and others had no problems as the engine was quite durable. Now Multi air ones like in the Alfa Romeo MiTos ( closest and cheaper to an Abarth ) had both T-Jets and Multiairs and they were kinda finicky but not a mass of them.

19,Proper LED Fog lights for Abarths (bolt on),jkbenn02,"TLDR: FCA part number 68228884AD uses the same brackets as Abarths. 

Warning‚Ä¶I‚Äôm used to long forum posts so forgive the rambling. Also another warning, the fogs aren‚Äôt installed yet. 

After successfully installing NHK Gen V bi-led headlight projector assemblies in my 2013 Abarth I wanted to complete the lighting package with proper LED fog lights. I had tried just bulbs (in the headlights) but I knew it wouldn‚Äôt provide good lighting and while also knowing that it would likely make me a menace to society riding around with light going everywhere.  At least I could confirm personally that they sucked. And they did.  

I say proper because far too many people are just swapping bulbs which just isn‚Äôt right. Shitty beam patterns‚Ä¶regardless of how much they claim that ‚Äúmy $50 led bulbs are great‚Äù. üôÑtrust me..they aren‚Äôt great. They may be brighter than halogens but the pattern is horrible even if you clock the bulbs in every direction. 

Anyways, I split the headlights via baking and installed the LED projectors in place of the original halogens using various adapters. It was a lot of work and well worth the effort. Now the  headlights are just amazing and on par with my Tesla 3 which are extremely good. I used aftermarket Depo headlights as I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the OE permaseal. It was still a painful process (hot headlights are no fun to open). At least this way I could take my time as the car still had the headlights in place. 

On to the main topic, the fog lights:

SURELY I‚Äôm not the first person to notice this but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else post this before. These cars have been out for over a decade and the community is pretty damn good especially when it comes to modding them. 

Anyways, I wanted to share this with you all. Despite all those out there claiming no replacements exist I believe I can prove otherwise. 

I think we can all agree that the Abarth fog assemblies have a distinctive look to them when removed. So off to eBay I went. A quick cross reference of the oe part number showed a number of the other FCA cars that used the same assembly. This gave me hope ü§£

Then I backed out that part number from my search and just put ‚ÄúLED Fog dodge‚Äù (or other brand such as Jeep) and you will quickly see factory LED fog lights that look almost identical to the Abarth fog lights. I could have stopped there and thrown those into my bumper but I wanted something better.  So if you want LED bolt in fog lights just stop here. For around ~$60 you can‚Äôt beat them.

I bought a cheap set of LED fog lights on eBay (part number 68228884AD) to compare to the Abarth‚Äôs fogs. I couldn‚Äôt tell a difference between the Abarth and Jeep brackets so I took the next step of getting Morimoto XB fog lights (part number LF620). These are marketed for all those other FCA models previously mentioned but no 500 Abarth at all but it only took me a few small leaps to make the ‚Äúconnection‚Äù)

If going the aftermarket OE route, just install them as delivered. I can‚Äôt comment on the wiring for those but the plug looks the same between the OE abarth H11 plug and the aftermarket OE style led. 

I‚Äôll be installing the Morimotos soon so I‚Äôll update this if there are any issues. Even if some type of resistor is needed that is still not a big deal. 

NOTE: The reflector on the aftermarket OE style are going to be about 3/8‚Äù shorter compared to the original fog lights BUT the chrome trim rings appear to be the same depth so there shouldn‚Äôt be a larger gap or anything like that. 

Perhaps I‚Äôm missing something mounting-wise and nobody is talking about it but I think this is a good solution for inexpensively upgrading your fogs to LEDs for about the same price as doing it the wrong way (just installing led bulbs into your halogen housings)

For some reason I can‚Äôt post links and pictures so send me a message if you‚Äôd like the pics or links.  I‚Äôll also try to post them as a reply.",5,7,0,7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/1335l64/proper_led_fog_lights_for_abarths_bolt_on/,1682799462.0,1335l64

I have a white 2013, mostly stock with the cravenspeed short shift and bracket. 84,000 miles. Very good condition (the red seat loops and hatch pull are intact lol)

I've only had one bite so far. Carvana only offered me about $7.5k but they're selling them for double that.

53,2021 Essesse cold start petrol smell,tastybagels_1,"Hello all,

I have a 2021 595 Essesse UK spec for about 2 weeks now so I'm quite unfamiliar with these little fire crackers still. Is it normal for these cars to have a petrol smell during cold start? The smell is outside the vehicle and doesn't come into the cabin at all unless I have the windows down. I've had hot hatches before like Type Rs and GR Yaris but none of them have a smell when started cold so am wondering if this is an Abarth quirk. Car is running standard 180hp with the standard Akrapovic exhaust.

Doesn't happen when car is pushed or warm.

So far I‚Äôve been really enjoying it, but the previous owner didn‚Äôt maintain the valve on the exhaust which is now seized. It can be either open or closed (you have to get under the car and manually pry it), so recently I‚Äôve been thinking of switching to a custom valved setup which will quiet the car for a daily and highway use, and open the pipes electronically when in ‚Äúfun‚Äù mode.

I know Monza Record‚Äôs were quite pricey in the options list and they add to the value od the overall package, but I think there are better options out there.

70,Major mechanical question: why is my car abnormally loud?,Commie-Procyon-lotor,"A couple weeks ago, I noticed that my 2013 Abarth (manual transmission), would have some sort of loud droning noise that spikes up in volume at intervals. I can hear it slightly at 35 miles per hour, then it would be twice as loud at 55 MPH, and it would sound up again at 75 MPH but isn't as loud as 55. So I assumed I had uneven wear on my rear tires since I heard it closer to the rear.

I went to a shop to have my tires rotated and rebalanced, and I still hear this droning towards the rear. I even noticed that as I accelerate from 50 to 60, the sound ""rolls"" from underneath the seat to the rear.

This droning noise even happens while I'm out of gear and the engine is at 1000RPM in highway speed and I don't hear sputtering/popping at all, so I don't think this is an exhaust leak.

It all started with a ""random multicylinder misfire"" that ended in replacing the engine.

Replacing those broken parts required removing the transmission and replacing the oil pan as well. After we got it all back together, it wouldn't start, then bad weather hit and it had to sit for a while. This weekend, after enough cranking to re-prime the fuel pump, it started! Aaaand, proceeded to dump most of the transmission fluid on the ground due to a bad seal on the transmission cooler.

148,"Welp, here's what ChatGPT has to say about turbo blankets",APB3,"I asked: 

I have a turbocharged car. Many companies sell insulating ""blankets"" for the turbocharger such that the heat on the hot side of the turbo becomes hotter and the intake charge on the cold side of the turbo becomes colder. As a result, power is increased. I'm not doubting that this is true, but I have a concern: by forcing the turbo to become hotter isn't it at risk of premature failure? The companies that make these blankets deny this, but I still worry.

It replied:

The use of insulating blankets on turbochargers can increase power output by reducing the amount of heat lost from the exhaust gases as they pass through the turbocharger. This reduces the amount of heat that is absorbed by the engine bay and the surrounding components, which can help to lower intake air temperatures and increase engine efficiency.

However, you are right to be concerned about the potential impact of increased temperatures on the turbocharger itself. Turbochargers are designed to operate within specific temperature ranges, and excessive heat can cause premature wear and failure of the turbocharger.

The manufacturers of these insulating blankets may deny any negative impact on the turbocharger, but it is important to understand that any modification to the turbocharger, including the use of insulating blankets, can affect its performance and longevity. The risk of premature failure may depend on factors such as the quality of the blanket, the operating conditions of the turbocharger, and the maintenance and care of the engine and turbocharger.

If you are considering using an insulating blanket on your turbocharger, it is important to do your research and choose a high-quality product that is designed specifically for your turbocharger model. You should also consult with a trusted mechanic or tuner who has experience with turbocharged engines to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of using such a product.

My cat got lucky today because my gf Abarth (2011 European 595C) didn't start when we wanted to go for the vet appointment. When I turned the key, I heard rapid clicking sound (sounded like relay), but nothing was happening, the alternator didn't even try to start the engine. On the next try, I also saw errors on the screen ""check gearbox"" (it is automatic) and ""power steering error"". On the next try, the screen also got very dark couldn't almost read anything from it, so it looked like a dead battery. I popped up the hood, checked the battery clamps, and a positive one was a bit loose (not totally loose, but I could twist it with my hands). So I thought that was the problem, went home, got some tools and a multimeter. Tightened the clamp and checked the voltage on the battery it was showing 12.00V, so not a dead battery as I initially thought, but after tightening the clamp still the same issue - won't start, throws lots of errors. So I also disconnected and reconnected ECU connectors and checked the error codes with the ODB scanner. It showed a lot of errors, but they all seem quite random, can't see any root cause there (full list [here](https://gist.github.com/DavidZisky/6b1f5c4760c34a3d0fe1c8c668f29b47)).

I have a base model Abarth 595 2016, which I have remapped to 187HP & 295NM.

When the car was remapped, it was fitted with a Forge Induction Kit which certainly gave a few monies. This was confirmed during the base power dyno runs.

I've had the Induction kit for a while now and like many other owners with the same setup, I have had enough of having a Dyson vacuum cleaner under my bonnet.

I would like to put the stock Filter back on, and I'm prepared for a bit of loss power due to this. My question is, if I put back the stock Filter which was not installed during the remap, will I get any engine codes or any other issues?

166,124 Spider owner with no car knowledge stuck in mechanic hell- help?,IHeartOurContinent,"Hello, I'm an owner of a Spider Abarth 124. Bought it three years ago. I now wonder if I just need to dump the car. It's my first ever car, I'm an NYC local and got my license about three months before I got the car. Cars are still an alien concept to me, particularly the mechanics. It's a great car to learn how to better drive with, but I hit a curb and now the alignment is off. I've been stuck in mechanic hell for the last week. I have a new job in FL and I'm in Los Angeles now. I have to get it shipped out by Wed. I keep having to order new parts. First the rims. That showed up. Shop owner at Pepboys said he had my tire. He didn't. They ordered, guarantee a day for tire to show. Three days later, no tire. So i towed it to another mechanic. It's Friday. He won't look at it til Monday. I need new suspension I was told. So if he looks at it Monday, will he tell me I need all these weird parts for the suspension that no other mechanic has and I have to order? Or is there a reasonable expectation this can be fixed in a day? I am buying a run flat that works tomorrow. I am hoping Monday morning, he has tires, rims, and can have my car ready Tuesday night. I don't need a ton of fixes. I really need the tire and rim on there so it can be in decent enough shape to be shipped.
But is even that unrealistic? And how much is suspension fix? I set aside 5k for the whole fix. I don't speak car language, I'm so ovweherlmed and while I tried getting help last Monday, I've faced a series of delays of not having parts, parts promised they'd ship quickly, they don't, and my car just sits there. Do I just toss the damn thing? Guy at shop offered me 1,500. Seems low. It's been all around the continent and handled tough terrain. It has 80k miles on it and has been to 15 states in Mexico, 20 in the US and four provinces in Canada. I've taken it through many long 6 minth road trips across North America. Wondering if it's time to say goodbye, or if you guys could help, tell me what questions to ask and how to be aggressive enough to get car fixed in a timely manner.

I found a 2013 Coupe for sale near me for $7000. 

It has 100K miles and has a clean CarFax, two owners. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

I got a mechanic with me to check it out yesterday and it had two codes - boost pressure high and boost pressure low. 

I was told this is a common symptom of a failing boost pressure sensor and it‚Äôs an easy fix. 

I was going to pick the car up today but the dealer called me and said that the mechanic I got cleared all the codes of the car and reset the system. 

This caused a couple codes to pop up that only go away with driving - according to the dealer. 

He says he needs to drive the car 50-100 miles for the systems to get in working order and for the codes to clear themselves so the car can pass emissions. 

Is this normal behavior or is he trying to pull a fast one?

I tested the MAP and Barometric pressure with my scanner. The MAP sensor seems to be working properly. The Barometric pressure did not change. I couldn‚Äôt find any info on a sensor or how to replace if that‚Äôs the problem.

Anyway, I got my mechanic to look at it and he replaced the shifter cables. Problem solved! Shifts are *much* easier and the stick re-centers just fine. 

However, I've noticed the stick moves side-to-side when in gear about 1.5"" in first, second, fifth, and reverse. Third and fourth maybe a little less, say 1.25"".

Went out for a 5 minute quick spin, around -5c here and noticed the engine was making these kinda raindrop sound after turning off the car to top up wiper fluid. 
Quick spin: City streets but was going around  110kmh at one brief point, trying to check if brakes are still screeching (See below for more details)

Is it just the engine cooling down and metal contracting & expanding from the heat?

My car is also making high pitch screeching noise in low speed (below 60kmh), but it goes away by braking. Tried taking the brake pads out and making sure they are clean and flat along with checking the rotor but noise still occurs. 

Had this screeching issue with my 2016 Sport and took it into shop and they said it was just uneven wear and filed it down for me and it disappeared, not sure if its the same issue with this one‚Ä¶..(the metal brakes pads looks fine, no rough spots or uneven wear as far as i can tell)

Yesterday, I started the car up and had another CEL and it was idling rough like the last time but this time I took it straight to a store and had it scanned. This time I got one code with no definition and another saying cylinder #4 was misfiring. I started the car back up after scanning, and it was idling smooth and sounded fine.  
The conclusion me and a buddy have come to is I need to replace the coils and spark plugs. Also, maybe this is why the MAP sensor was so dirty, because it just wasn't burning hot enough?

Checked under the oil cap today and found a fair bit of ‚Äúmayo‚Äù

Coolant levels are fine

Reaches and holds temp fine

Hot air blowing as usual

It‚Äôs -1 Celsius in the UK right now so a little ‚Äúsmoke‚Äù coming out of the exhaust.

I cleaned it out, took it out for around 30 mins, wiped the tiny amount that had built up, then took it out for about another 45 mins with motorways and getting through the rev range nicely. No loss of power. Still a tiny film of mayo on the cap but a very thin film.

Do you think this could be a head gasket, or just cold weather plus my 10 min drives to work and back everyday?

Usually does get a longer run on the weekend but I haven‚Äôt checked under the cap until now.

297,Help With Ideas As To Why Car Won't Start - Low Battery + Electronic Throttle Control Warning Light,HipHopHistoryGuy,"Hi all. My 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth Cabriolet manual transmission with 68,000 miles has been in the shop since Jan. 4, 2023 with the following situation and wondering if anyone could assist with any expertise as to what can be going on.

**Below is what occurred:**

* Driving home on one hour drive via highway.
* Two miles before home, dash ""battery charging system light"" (battery icon) goes on/off approx. every 15 seconds
* One mile before home, dash ""electronic throttle control warning light"" (lightning bolt icon) goes on/off approx. every 15 seconds.
* 1/2 mile before home both lights remain solid and not randomly blinking on/off.
* Pull into local garage which is open. Engine begins sputtering a bit.
* Negative cable on battery was a bit loose (I had switched battery myself 6 months ago). Mechanic tightens negative battery cable to battery. Car turns off (I believe we turned off engine and it didn't stall)
* Car will NOT turn back on. Car has power but engine is not cranking.
* EDIT (added): Battery is checked and is outputting proper voltage.
* Mechanic checks for codes which supposedly resets the computer system in the process. I recall him saying multiple codes were showing up and to leave the car. Tech believes it's the starter since the engine won't crank.
* Mechanic calls - says the starter needs to be replaced. Cost $600 USD w/ labor.
* Mechanic calls - starter replaced and apparently needed replacement, however it did not fix the issue.
* They are now getting a code pointing to the alternator so they are testing the alternator for improper voltage.
* Mechanic believes it could be the alternator but hoping it's not the ECU.

**Notes:** Car has a 500 Madness ECM piggyback as well as a GoPedal.

My questions for the experts here is does the diagnosis so far seem correct? I really don't want to go bankrupt trying to get my beauty fixed if I should be going to a different mechanic who specializes in Fiat. I'm concerned they will repair the alternator and then tell me it didn't fix the issue and loop will continue. The closest Fiat dealer from me is 20 miles away and I would need to have it towed there since the car won't start.

Also, I am 8 miles west of Boston. If anyone is in this area and swears by their mechanic, I could use any recommendations for either this or future repairs. Thank you for reading and any assistance.

**UPDATE 1/20/23:** Mechanic called and new starter was broken. Tried another one - also broken. Tested both starters outside of the car and they work. Tested my original starter outside of the car and **IT WORKED**. Put starter back in my car and would not turn on. Apparently, there is a tricky way regarding the wiring to power the starter which was not set correctly. Once this was figured out after several phone calls from my mechanics to others, the car turned on without issues! He replaced the negative terminal to the battery as apparently it was having trouble staying tight.

With that said, we will do not know why the car would not turn back on when I originally brought the Abarth to the mechanic with the two dash lights on. I do believe those two lights originally went on from a loose negative terminal to the battery. However, after tightening the negative terminal and clearing out the ECU's codes, the car should have cranked the starter and turned on but it did not. My only guess is there was some sort of safety initiated that prevented the clutch sensor or ignition sensor from allowing the starter to crank? I'll be keeping an eye on it over the next week to see if anything odd occurs but crossing my fingers.",8,3,0,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/10aw71o/help_with_ideas_as_to_why_car_wont_start_low/,1673620961.0,10aw71o

Before I let her have free reign, I am driving it to ensure everything is kosher.  I have found and fixed a few things already but this week I have started to notice a burning plastic smell.  Definitely plastic and NOT rubber or oil.  I can only think that it's clutch or brake related but I haven't been able to narrow it down to either just yet.  I don't smell it on a drive until I come to a stop but both clutch and brakes are being used at that time.  Other than those, I also had the heated seats on and would notice the seats were getting warmer when the smell would come up.  If it were the seats, I would imagine I'd smell it while cruising, but only happens at start/stop at an intersection.  

The clutch has been making a ""honk"" sound from a dead stop but only half way up the pedal travel.  If the car is in motion and the clutch is depressed, it doesn't make the sound.",11,2,0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/zz21ne/burning_plastic_smell_2012_abarth_500/,1672411017.0,zz21ne

348,Abarth Problem : ESC / HILL HOLD CONTROL / TIRE PRESSURE / ENGINE CONTROL signals,Romsenderulo,"Hello everyone,

So i had to repost this topic in English, 

I'm an Abarth XSR from 2018 owner 

Since i bought the car in 2020, i started having some issues at around 25 000km.

**ESC, Hill Hold Control, Tire pressure, and Engine Control** lights started to **light up  inadvertently.**

It happen like that : 

**First, i have all the signals for 3 to 6 start up then only Engine Control for 1 or 2 startup then Nothing,  then it comes back.**

So sometimes I drive with no lights issues, and sometimes i start the vehicle, and boom everything is here. With absolutely no reason.

**Here is what I've done on  the car :**

 \-> Changing the clutch (go figure why the car was still under warranty at the time, I didn't pay anything) (done at the Abarth garage). When i got back the car, i ddnt have to problem for 1 or 2 months

 \-> Brake sensor change *( no changes )*

\-> Battery change  *( no changes )*

\-> Changing the Turbo sensor (done at the Abarth garage) *( no changes )*

\-> Changed another sensor (no idea which one.. done at the Abarth garage)  *( no changes )*

\> They told me they would change the throttle body, but an acquaintance of mine had made this change, but that didn't solved anything to his problem (same as mine) 

**I have noticed that the problem happens MUCH more often in the summer than in the winter**.

 My only solution for removing these indicator lights: -> Restart the car until it goes away. ( it can be from 3 to 6 times) but never less than 3

Also, i noticed that these signals was removed every 3 starts up, but now it can be more.. i don't know why.

When everything is light up, it's like the car is in ""protection mode"" i cannot accelerate as i want, clutch is weird ( like 2 to 3 is very  unpredictable )

The engine in it is fairly ok still, it just has signs of poor maintenance history from the previous owner that are showing up. The reason we'd be building it is to get more power and because we're either going to rebuild this one or build a new one. Preference on building a new one so the car is still drivable at all times until the swap is done. If I do that I'd probably plop the bigger turbo, FMIC and put the works in the engine. I am not precisely sure what that entails, but something in the vein of better pistons, cam, block, bottom and top end if possible.

We see this on any number of items, the most offensive being the ""big injectors"" being sold for the US Abarth. These are Bosch PN 0280158117.... Go ahead and try to find that info on any vendor page listing the big injectors for sale... Insult to injury is if you had one fail on you, you're out of luck trying to find an individual replacement without reaching out to a vendor who may or may not want to sell you an individual part. On all listings on our site, we're going to include OEM Part numbers so you can find these for yourself if need be. Thank you

TLDR; Parts vendors are hiding part numbers for products preventing the community from finding them anywhere else.",16,30,0,30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/zlvhqk/an_open_letter_about_parts_vendors/,1671035546.0,zlvhqk

392,ABARTH Voyants : Esc + Hill Hold Control + Controle pression pneus indisponible + Controlez moteur de mani√®re intempestive,Romsenderulo,"Bonjour √† tous,

Je suis l'heureux propri√©taire d'une abarth XSR de 2018. 

Depuis l'achat de ma voiture en 2020, j'ai commenc√© √† avoir aux alentours des 25K Kilom√®tres, les voyants ESC, Hill Hold Control, Pression pneus  et contr√¥le moteur, de mani√®re intempestive au d√©marrage.

Cela fait maintenant 2ans que √ßa vient et √ßa part.. sans aucune raison.

Voil√† les changements qui ont √©t√© fait et qui n'ont rien r√©solu : 

\-> Changement de l'embrayage ( allez savoir pourquoi √† l'√©poque la voiture √©tait encore sous garanti, je n'ai rien pay√©) (fait au garage abarth)

\-> Changement de capteur de frein 

\-> Changement de la batterie 

\-> Changement de la sonde Turbo (fait au garage abarth)

\-> Changement d'une autre sonde ( aucune id√©e laquelle.. fait au garage abarth)

\-> Ils m'ont dit qu'ils changeraient le corps papillon , mais une de mes connaissance √† √©t√©

faire ce changement mais cela n'a rien chang√© √† son probl√®me (le m√™me que le mien)

J'ai remarqu√© que le probl√®me arrive BEAUCOUP plus souvent en √©t√© qu'en hiver.

Ma seule solution pour retirer les voyants est la suivante : 

\-> Red√©marrer la voiture jusqu'√† que √ßa parte.

J'esp√®re que ce topic sera le dernier de la s√©rie. C'est un probl√®me qui concerne beaucoup de voitures du groupe Stellantis dans ces ann√©es l√†.

Tried it a few times and it cranked but no start, waiting a few and tried it again to have a very sluggish start. The car had sat parked since Wednesday evening

After that I drove to the store without issue, shopped for an hour, came back out and she fired right up

Then this morning I go out (29F at the time) and the same thing, though I got a start on the second time. Drove to the gas station, filled up, and then started right back up again

I had one od the spark plugs fail earlier, which a shop that I ended up with swapped for a BRISK, but not the whole set (no shop around had them in store).

So I also switched the whole set of plugs out for some standard Bosch ones (can't get the recommended NKG, seem to be only OEM here in Czechia).

 Seems to have solved the issue, so highly recommended to anyone pushing more than 180bhp on their 1.4 multiair.

I've recently cleaned the Air/Oil separator of all the built up gunk and oil after 20k Miles, and I was wondering if anyone's done it themselves before?

I couldn't find any YouTube Vidoes on how to do this on the Euro spec cars, as all the videos were on the American spec Abarths, and their separator looks a bit different.

Nonetheless, I gave it a go (super easy) and cleaned a lot of gunk and oil out.

It appears the separator has a couple of seals which allow/prevent air coming in and out a certain way. I can't imagine they worked very well with all the build-up inside.

Once cleaned with brake cleaner, they open/closed as they should perfectly every time.

There are 3 openings to the separator (don't bother trying to unscre the cap on top) which I sprayed brake cleaner into, until the cleaner run clear. 

I also replaced the O-Ring on the separator where it connects to the top of the engine.

If you guys give this a try yourselves, let me know what treasures you find inside ü§Æ

I've also heard that the Air/Oil separator can be linked to high engine oil consumption, but we'll see.",2,8,0,8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/xx1t9f/airoil_separator_service/,1665051848.0,xx1t9f

Will 16s bolt on just fine or will there be issues with clearance? Doesn't seem to have the giant Brembo brakes on so I'm guessing it should be fine....larger sidewall of the 16s might help protect against some of the crappy roads I'll be driving on.

626,500 Abarth Won't Start After Sitting For Six Weeks,dizzysn,"2013 500 Abarth, 125k miles, bone stock. Car ran just fine when parked, and the 6 months old battery reads 12.6V. I have a single lane driveway and didn't feel like playing musical cars for a few weeks, so it sat. But now when I try to start it, it just cranks and cranks. I can hear sound from the exhaust, so the motor is definitely spinning: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uba-PtlEiC8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uba-PtlEiC8)

Research leads me to believe all the oil drained from the Multi-air brick, because the car sounds like it has no compression at all.

So far I've followed the Fiat guide which says to crank the car for 15 seconds, wait 15 seconds, crank 15 seconds, and repeat that step. If it doesn't kick over within 10 tries, let the starter cool, and try again. I've done this probably 20 times so far.

I've also opened the oil fill cap, and tried to depress the small relief valve that it's in there, while having someone crank it, as seen in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aJuiVhgsNw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aJuiVhgsNw)

But that relief doesn't move even a millimeter for me. I pushed down as hard as I possibly could, and still nothing.

I've also tried pulling the F21 fuse, cranking it a bunch, then putting the fuse back in to try to start it, to no avail.

At this point I'm lost on how to move forward.

UPDATE: Took engine cover off, and oil fill tube. Turns out, there's no ball bearing at all. I can see the coils of the spring sitting in there sideways. And I found styrofoam on top of the brick.

651,Does your North American 500 Abarth burn more oil in Sport mode? Also dry dipstick story.,Milnoc,"I'm on vacation and using my 2015 Abarth with 75,000 km as transportation. Most of the 1,300 km is from highway driving in Sport mode.

I discovered during my regular checks during a fill-up that the dipstick was dry. It's always been very difficult to get an accurate reading because the Euro Platinum is too clear and clean in my car. I got around this problem by rolling the dipstick on a clean shop wipe and matching the stain with the dipstick.

I also believe the oil left inside the dipstick tube stil manages to coat the dipstick when pulled out the second time, giving me a false reading that the engine is topped off. I suspect my car has always burned a bit of oil, but the dipstick always had a coating of oil because of the oil left in the dipstick tube screwing things up.

I found a way to read the oil accurately with only one extra step. The first and third steps are the same (pull out, wipe clean, reinsert, pull out, read), but the second step involves reinserting the dipstick until it hesitates. Instead of pushing the dipstick all the way in, you pull it out and wipe again. That cleaned out any oil left in the dipstick tube, and no extra oil was dragged into the dipstick tube.

After I added a quart of oil a bit at a time and tried my technique to confirm the oil level was coming up, applying the dipstick on a shop wipe revealed the oil level was back to the top of the mark, and no oil was present on the skinny part of the dipstick after the top mark.

Worst case scenario is my car ran on 3 quarts of oil for a while. But as Tyler Hoovie discovered with his cheapest Abarth, the engine can still run on a single quart of oil! Not that I'd want to test that out.

Aside from this one hiccup, the car has been performing beautifully during this long drive! No CEL, no error codes in any state, no nothing! I'll keep monitoring the oil levels along with the coolant levels in case it's revealed I have a leak somewhere. Up to now, no mysterious puddles or self-lubricating chassis.

How many here have numbers on how much oil their Abarth consumes and in which driving mode?

ADDENDUM: Along with the sport/non-sport question, which oil do you use? I just remembered this is the first time I'm using Pennzoil Platinum Euro. The previous oil was Castrol Edge.

669,Looking to pick up 2013 500 Abarth with ~50k miles.,TroglodytesAnonymous,"So I am choosing the worst time to buy an Abarth. I am seeing prices \~12-20k for cars I swear were 8-10 two years ago. It is what it is and I want one.

I am no stranger to keeping a vehicle running in my own garage and I like the overall look and interior of the 2013. From my understanding, there were some steering and turbo changes to address common issues moving into MY2014. However, I cannot find a clear description of what those issues are and if they are rectifiable via aftermarket (I mean, of course they are, probably). 

&#x200B;

This will not be my daily. It will see autocross. I need to take a look at classing to see what can be done without moving out of stock or the first class, but I am looking at baselining the vehicle and sorting common issues. It had four owners and is shipping from across the country, so I anticipate a bit of previous owner fuckery to tackle. I am just having it transferred, but have not purchased it yet. I'll do a final inspection to look out for anything ghastly, but good god is the sale price ridiculous right now. But, I want it. It is what it is.

&#x200B;

The things I know I need to sort from reading through here and elsewhere:  


Alfa 4C Coil packs

Intake boot above the exhaust shield

Check for boost leaks

Short throw shifter and poly bushing

Check AC since blower failure is frequent

Turbo failures... common?

Some sort of control arm issue- are there better aftermarket parts to avoid it? What is the actual issue?

Door handles/armrests/window motors/rear latch (keep spares?)

&#x200B;

If this model year is a bad buy I am open to other options if it's important, but this particular model had all the look and feel bits (sunroof, black pinstriping, heated seats, beats audio, manual, and red exterior/red dash with the dark bronze wheels). For some reason I saw it and just latched onto it moving through a sea of options. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, it's Carmax so another part of me debates if the 3k for the 5 year bumper to bumper would be worth it just to cover the AC/Turbo, but honestly the turbo going out sounds like a good excuse to put better parts in than came out so I am really just thinking about the AC. It's hot AF in Texas.

722,Purchased a 2015 Abarth and it's the funnest car I have ever owned... but there are 3 things bugging me... can you help?,twoshooz,"1. The arm rests are driving me nuts. When I'm driving and shifting through gears, my right arm sits right \*between\* the two arms rests, so each of them is pushing its nubby little bits into my arm from different angles. Those things are the size of hot dogs and the texture of a little kid's red plastic baseball bat. Has anybody found a solution to this? I don't even know what that would be...
2. Similarly, I drive with my left arm up and hand on the top of the steering wheel. This causes the seat belt to dig into the side of my neck. It feels like there is a little line of fire ants marching back and forth. Again, I don't know what the solution could be (I've tried to change body positions, move the seat around, etc)...
3. I listen to music from my phone through bluetooth. I have to turn the volume up on the head unit quite a bit to hear at a good level. But every time I get back into the car, the stereo has defaulted to the ""tuner"" which blasts whatever shitty FM station it is tuned to and makes me want to yell bad words. Am I missing something in the menu that will allow it to remember the last thing it was on (bluetooth) instead of assaulting me with Ted Nugent and static at high volume?

Im a relatively new owner of an Abarth 595 2016 model and I've come across an issue.

Im not sure it happens everytime because i usually shift at 5k rpm, but when accelerating hard and going past 5-6k I notice the car lurches forwards and completely cuts power despite not reaching redline and having my foot 100% on the gas.

Drives normal until i hit a high RPM.

Has anyone experienced this before or knows what's going on?

Regardless, I made it back to Brooklyn from Lower CT with a knocking sound (increasing in frequency with acceleration) coming from the engine. I dropped the car off yesterday and spoke to my guy today. The noise is coming from the engine so he's going to start the claim through the warranty company. He said It's going to cost me $1k for the engine tear down. And that usually, they will need to replace the engine. Something I cannot afford to do and am hopeful the warranty pays. I mean, this is the exact kind of issue they're supposed to cover. They didn't cover the door handle that stopped working after my kid pulled on it. They didn't cover an issue with the clutch.

Im the 2nd owner (since 22k) and she only has 32k mi now. 

Had to leave the car up there at my relatives and rent a car to get the fam back to Brooklyn. After 10/15 different calls, found a Mechanic that works on Fiats. All the other foreign mechanics are like ""nah! We don't work on those!"". They're picking it up today and hopefully I'll have an estimate by eod or tomorrow. 

Previous place I called ""Autobahn European Auto"" told me it could be around $2k depending on additional damage, which sounded hella expensive. Most I figured would be $1k.

I got a Tork Motorsports stage 1 tune for my 2013 Abarth about 4 months ago and ever since then I've been having low/underboost issues. 

The guys at tork Motorsports have been great at providing help, but nothing I've tried has made a difference. 
Here's what I've tried so far:

Adjusting preload on stock wga 
Checking intake and boost hoses for leaks
Installing a turbo smart wga and setting the recommended preload from tork Motorsports (4-6 mm) 

I'm running out of ideas here. Anyone with a smiliar situation and a solution?",4,1,0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/vmxc7z/tork_motorsports_tune_and_cel_p0299_turbo/,1656449037.0,vmxc7z

So I live in Israel and I'm seeing this e2 models where each one has a certain level where they are basically the same (talking about engine specs only here) 
Let's the the abarth 500 comp (2013) has 160 bhp like the 595 San marino for example

So i‚Äòve gotten my Brand new Abarth F595 like nearly 4 months ago. Basically since ive had it there was a weird problem with the transmission while taking off when ur stopped.

It doesnt happen always or everyday, sometimes just  twice a day sometimes for a whole week.  

When you take off and release the clutch slowly the car starts to vibrate/shake this only happens in first and 2nd gear. And it gradually gets worse with time. In the beginning it was just a little vibration but now its really annoying to drive.  Especially in stop and go traffic. 

I also let others test drive it to see if it may be just a problem while im operating it but no it happened to eveyone. 

I already called the dealer  bc of the warranty but they told me they cant take a look at it since they dont have the right equipment for abarths bc they just recently started selling them ?!?  They also wont service it.

859,Best FMIC You can get for a 500T 2013,Beneficial-Average22,"Hello Everyone, I am relatively new to the Abarth community here on reddit and have found a lot of helpful tips and tricks that I will keep in mind on my current project. My car (Fiat 500T 2013 with 130k miles) is being completely rebuilt. I live in Ohio where rust is a major problem and I love my car and I am willing to learn everything I can about cars and specifically 500's. What started this is the cruel treatment dealerships have given me around here. But at the end of the day I am a IT guy to car guy somehow. The current modifications on the car were small things that needed to be changed out and fixed. Such as Sparks, Coils, Diverter Valve, Madness Go Pedal, Removed Cat (sounds awesome) and many many bolts being replaced due to poor treatment from mechanics over the years. Next on the list which I do have all the parts for is MaxFlow Induction Kit, Cover Plate, Valve Springs (with all the gaskets and silicon due to mileage and leaky cylinder1 plug), Custom Exhaust 2.5"" single and Front Mounted Brace. The next thing I can not quite figure out is what truly is the next step to go after these parts. I am aware I still need a Madness Tune (important due to my warranty) but I would like everything that needs to be in place done first. This brings me to my original question for the community, what truly is the best intercooler around that is actively kept in stock and truly had a impact on performance while also being able to stand the test of time. This car will be the end all be all of performance. The end goal of all of these things will be hopefully and dyno of 250 HP or more.

If there is anymore questions on the next thing I will be doing after the intercooler it should be changing the coils struts and subframe brace as well as the hats on the struts. After we do that it will be Rims and tires from 16"" to 17"" Madness Rims that I have chosen. Yes the rotors and brakes will be upgraded due to the stopping power I would need at that rate. Meth Injection will be the very last thing due to the risk when I can afford to replace the engine if I have to.

I'm in the market for an Abarth and happened upon a tuned one for a great deal. Initially I planned to do my own Stage 1/2, but this is too great a deal to pass up. It was a play car for someone wealthy (other cars are tuned BMWs, Ferrari, Range), so he doesn't mind losing money on the tune. It's Stage 3 tune with Intercooler, DP, exhaust, hybrid Turbo, e wastegate exhaust, etc. Awaiting full buildsheet and dyno results. Says it's getting 240WHP peak if I remember correctly. It's a 2017 with 70k km on the clock and 25-30k on the total build, about 10k on the tune.

Is there anything I should be on the lookout for/is this a really, really bad idea? TIA!

Edit: updated some of the details after checking with sellers rep. it has stock internals, but the tune is ""only"" 240 on peak. also seller's rep cleared up the story. He's the first owner and used it before Covid to commute. During Covid, he and his mechanic friend started building it, and only upgraded the tune more recently.

I replaced a pair of whiteline adjustable end links that I installed a while back with DNA end links. I won't name the vendor for the whiteline links, because I never made them aware of this issue - perhaps it is operator error, but they don't really fit the car. It seems the adjustability of the whiteline links bottoms out on the 500 so that you cannot set the pre-load with the stock suspension.

So I got the DNA links installed, and yes they are beautiful, and they have more than enough adjustable range, but I don't really know what I am doing with pre-load. I know that pre-load isn't super relevant to road use, but I have the goal of slowly making this a track car.

895,Odd starting issue for 595 Comp,NsWelsh,"EDIT: TLDR weird issue where car wouldn't start after 2-12 hours after driving it. Turned out to be the fuel pump getting power but not kicking in so a replacement pump overall resolved it.

Hi all. I've had my 595 Comp since Jan 2021 and this week I started having a bizarre behaviour where I can't start the car. It's a 2014 with 34k miles, 4k of those being me so it has quite light usage.

Has anyone else experienced the same behaviour below or have any idea what could be the cause? I'm thinking heat-related issue as it's failed after each time the car has gotten to running temp.

Short version:
After I've driven more a couple of miles and have left the car off for an hour or two, I can't start it back up. Key turns, dash lights up, no engine light, no fuel pump sound which I normally hear and then engine just tries turning over but doesn't catch. It started on Monday (4 days ago) and the issue went away on its own the next morning, so myself and my mechanic couldn't diagnose anything. The initial recovery van thinks it wasn't getting fuel as it would turn over use Easy Start.
EDIT: This ended being a bad earth connection causing intermittent start issues.

Longer version:
**Monday 23rd May**
- Drove normally for 10 miles.
- Stopped for about an hour.
- 7pm turned the key once, no fuel pump sound as there normally is. Turn the key one step further to start and it initially turned over for 2 seconds before dying off.
- Further turns of the key had the engine trying to turn over but not catching. No warning lights showing on dash.
- Recovery van came out and the car would run with Easy Start being sprayed but it would die as soon as spraying stopped.
- No engine codes via OBD except for one about the heating system.
Car towed to outside my normal mechanic.

**Tuesday 24th May**
- 1pm the engine started on its first try with nothing being done to it following the night before. Every subsequent start, with either key, worked fine too.
- Handed keys into my normal mechanic to try and diagnose. They couldn‚Äôt replicate the issue at all and no codes showed.

**Wednesday 25th May**
- I collected keys from the mechanic and drove the car 0.5miles home.

**Friday 27th May**
- I drove the car 3 miles no issue.
- Car turned off for 2 hours.
- Exactly the same issue as Monday where there was no fuel pump sound and the car wouldn't start.
- 7pm tried turning the car over again with the same issue.

I'm currently waiting overnight and will try the car again tomorrow, in the hope that it's like Tuesday and starts again for some reason, just enough for me to drive it back to the mechanic.

**UPDATE:** Sat 28th May. Wouldn't start this morning either but I have a whole host of warnings on the dash, most likely due to running down battery from all the start attempts. I'm going to try a jumper with it later or tomorrow. OBD couldn't get a reading from the car so maybe something wrong with the ignition?

**UPDATE:** Sun 29 May. The car started using a jumper pack, which obviously points at battery, but I can't see any sense why it would fail after driving a few miles. maybe the alternator isn't charging it? New battery was in March/April.

**UPDATE:** Wed 22nd June. A bad earth connection was found by the mechanics and fixed, and the issue has not happened again since.",19,3,0,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/uz96pz/odd_starting_issue_for_595_comp/,1653689557.0,uz96pz

So before chasing big power I want to rebuild the engine so that once I wind the boost up on a new turbo, I'm not going to be panicking that the engine may throw a rod.

So can anyone recommend pistons and rods? This is pretty much all I've been able to find, I want to get an idea before i get a quote from a tuner. So any thoughts or recommendations welcome üëç

925,Cabrio vs Hardtop,RallyVincentCZ75,"Interested in buying an Abarth 500 here in the states. There's a 2013 near me that I was looking into, but I've also been considering finding a cabrio model. I used to have (technically still have but it doesn't work) an Audi S4 cabriolet and with things warming up and with a vacation even coming soon I'm just kinda considering a drop top. I know it's not a true convertible, but a retractable roof is a nice option, not to mention hearing more of that exhaust. 

Of course, with that you do kinda lose the daily functionality of a hatch. Sure the rear seats still fold but you don't have the big hatch opening. I'm also wondering about the visibility detractments, convertibles often have less visibility than a hard top when the top isn't rolled down. I'm wondering if owners of the cabrio could weigh in on that. There isn't one for sale near me I can look at, so I can't really compare it to the hardtops in person. 

Was wondering what the opinions were, I suppose. Also I guess if those roofs are any good. Commonly faulty or leaky, easy to maintain if they do break, horrible nightmare part, etc... If I did get one, I don't currently plan to drive in the winter with it, if that makes a difference for functionality.",15,6,0,6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/uo1el9/cabrio_vs_hardtop/,1652362978.0,uo1el9

927,695 Competizione with auto gearbox for the wife,valain,"Dear community,

We're soon moving to a larger city in Europe that is known for heavy traffic. My partner fell in love with the 695 competizione, mainly because of the size and the looks, and also a bit for the performance but she's definitely not ""a sporty driver"".

We're thus looking for the automatic gearbox, and there are very mixed reviews, so I wanted to reach out here and ask owners how they feel about it. The new car's usage will be 85% inner city driving, and 15% periurban roads and highway.

Given my wife's ""driver profile"", and the usage she will make of the car, is the auto a good option?

So i‚Äòve recently bought a brand new Abarth F595 like 2 months ago and already drove nearly 5500 km. 
I love the car to pieces but i gotta admit it does have some problems that just annoy the crap out of me. 

Before i run to the dealer i just wanted to know if some of you might know what might be wrong with it . 

Firstly, cold starts are a pain in the arse the car sounds and acts like its drowning in fuel  its starts then dies and then starts right back up. Its doing this since the 600 km mark. 

Onto the next problem. When idling at a red light or whatever the engine vibrates weirdly  mostly when its cold  but also sometimes when its warmed up.  Sometimes it even drops to around 500 rpm and theni have to rev it a little cause im scared it will just die on me. 
Tho it hasnt done that since around 1000 km. 


And the last thing is the cluth or the gearbox in general. This isnt my first manual car and ive never had any problems at all but since the 2000 km mark its basically impossible to take off smoothly from stand still. It always vibrates slightly or fells like the cluth is slipping. This also occurs when shifting from 1st-2nd gear. 

As i said i love the car and its loads of fun to drive but those things just annoy me. 

Thanks in Advance.",8,2,0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/ubh1sk/abarth_problems/,1650878796.0,ubh1sk

983,I think I'm overpaying for maintenance,BK2Jers2BK,"In Brooklyn, NY so prices are already going to be high but as an example. Took my 2013 Abarth in for her 30k mile service this morning. This is my regular place and I like them. They're billing me $290 if I pay cash, for the following: Cabin Air Filter: $45, $150 for the spark plugs, and $95 for the oil change. What are you guys shelling out for similar service items? 

Note, I changed both headlamp bulbs myself a couple of weeks ago. I asked my guy today what he would have charged me if I brought it in and had them do it instead. He said $150 for the labor. 

I'm starting to think I should do more on my own but I'm not super handy.",31,7,0,7,,https://www.reddit.com/r/abarth/comments/u80s09/i_think_im_overpaying_for_maintenance/,1650473068.0,u80s09
