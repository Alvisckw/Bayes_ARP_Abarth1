1,Abarth Punto Evo S&S Multiair 163 cv,MPortovedo,"Hey everyone, currently I am looking to buy a 2011 Abarth Punto Evo S&S Multiair 163 hp with 114000Km. ( I'm from Portugal btw)

I have the licence plate and the VIN number to search for previous incidents involving the car and if the mileage has not been adulterated (apparently that's a problem with car stands in portugal and it started to worry me because it's a bit odd a car from 2011 only having 114K).

The car has supposedly full maintenance record and I will inspect it.

What do you advise to look for while doing the test drive??",0,1,0,1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/15fpmu9/abarth_punto_evo_ss_multiair_163_cv/,1690925804,15fpmu9
2,Strange Issue with my 500 Abarth - Drives fine in Sport mode but not normal?,TechXPlays,"I have a 2013 500 Abarth (North American 1.4 SOHC).   
\- Stock GT1446 turbo with turbosmart bov and wastegate (10 psi spring)  
\- 500 madness CAI  
\- 500 Madness Coil Packs  
\- tork tuned stage 1 no pops/bangs (but this issue happens on stock tune WORSE)

3 Days ago, I popped a P0299 (common) and P1068 CEL. Cleared em, no biggy, it is about time for an oil change as its been about 3500 miles since the last one.

YESTERDAY, P0299, P1068, P2178 and a definite misfire. Sounded like a cammed big block till I shut it off. Also had the little lightning bolt symbol (that's next to flat tire light) on dash pop up.

I cleared all the codes, but acceleration clearly was hurting IN NORMAL NON-SPORT MODE DRIVING. I got to work, let it sit all day till about 2:30PM (got there at 9am). Drove it home. 

Fast forward about 3 hours that same day, had to drive it to get somewhere. I had the thought ""What happens if I sport mode drive only?""  


The car drove like there were NO ISSUES AT ALL. I have data logs from several drives recently, unfortunately not when it shut off of course... Anyone else experience this?

8,Where do I put Abarth logo in my Fiat Stilo?,tatwftw,"Hi there, how are you guys?

&#x200B;

I own a Fiat Stilo ~~Abarth~~ 2005 three doors and have acquired recently an Abarth logo.

I'm having doubts about where to put it, what do you think?

*Edit: It's not the Abarth model, I thought it was. I'll put the insignia anyway*
