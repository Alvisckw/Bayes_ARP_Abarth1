0,Fiat 500L Front Struts...,IDKIJustWorkHere2,"Been looking for front struts for my car and sadly they are about $400 bucks a pop, not even a loaded strut either. But i bought a used strut from an abarth at the junkyard and bolted it up, evwrything bolted up fine except the lower strut bolts were 10mm instead of 12mm so i had to enlarge the hole. however my question is do you think the 500L's weight is too much for the struts? The car has 160,xxx miles on it but i really dont wanna drop a grand into just front struts.",5,2,0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/131pkq1/fiat_500l_front_struts/,1682683037.0,131pkq1

3,Major mechanical question: abnormally loud noise?,Commie-Procyon-lotor,"A couple weeks ago, I noticed that my 2013 Abarth (manual transmission), would have some sort of loud droning noise that spikes up in volume at intervals. I can hear it slightly at 35 miles per hour, then it would be twice as loud at 55 MPH, and it would sound up again at 75 MPH but isn't as loud as 55. So I assumed I had uneven wear on my rear tires since I heard it closer to the rear.

I went to a shop to have my tires rotated and rebalanced, and I still hear this droning towards the rear. I even noticed that as I accelerate from 50 to 60, the sound ""rolls"" from underneath the seat to the rear.

This droning noise even happens while I'm out of gear and the engine is at 1000RPM in highway speed and I don't hear sputtering/popping at all, so I don't think this is an exhaust leak.

I assume its from damage from debris on the road, but it's so hard to tell.",6,2,0,2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/12jd2ql/major_mechanical_question_abnormally_loud_noise/,1681282099.0,12jd2ql

9,Just wanted to post this somewhere because I resolved it. FIAT 500 No Crank/No Start,_UsUrPeR_,"Hey all. I just finished fixing my mother-in-law's Fiat 500. It was having intermittent starting problems, and I wasted a bunch of time and money on it, but have finally resolved the problem.

Vehicle:

   * 2012 Fiat 500 Sport - 150,000 miles
   * Manual 5-speed transmission
   * 1.4L engine

Symptoms:

Intermittent start, no start. Battery seemed to be good, but vehicle would not crank, no starter engage, no solenoid click.

Resolution:

First, I replaced the starter, presuming that the intermittent start was caused by its age. This seemed to temporarily resolve the issue, which reappeared the next month.

Second, I checked the ground strap from body to transmission. It appeared to be on the verge of failure, so I purchased two battery cables from Autozone - one I ran to replace the original strap from the body to the transmission (which required the removal of the clutch slave cylinder. Reminder: keep some tension on the slave with a zip tie, or it will pop out, and you'll have to bleed the clutch). Still no luck on starting.

Finally, I followed the hint of jumping out the clutch switch detailed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uze9mUXP33c). This was the resolution: the clutch switch relay had failed. I jumped out the relay with a piece of wire just like in the video, and the vehicle starts just fine now. I realize that the video shows an Abarth, but the clutch switch relay is in the same location.

Problem solved! I am purchasing a new clutch switch relay, but in the mean time, everything is working just fine!

I just wanted to post this in case anybody has had this issue. I would prefer that no one duplicate my process because it cost about $400 for me to get to this point.",1,3,0,3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/11e7yic/just_wanted_to_post_this_somewhere_because_i/,1677594225.0,11e7yic

18,"Engine Problems (Abarth, please help!)",Squabbles123,"Hello, I'm seeking any knowledge or advice about what to do with my 2015 Fiat 500 Abarth.   I totally love the car, I have some attachment to it, and it may have just died and I'm really hoping I can find someone on here that may give me something to try before I give up hope and am forced to basically scrap the car.  

So, its 5 years old, 59k miles, but been my daily driver for those 5 years, mostly to work, recently my miles have really increased and about 10k of those are in the past 3-4 months alone.   During that time I had something weird happen, all the dash lights lit up and went a bit weird, the car actually shut off for a split second, then turned itself back on, and resumed like nothing happened, all while in motion, that was like a month ago.

This issue:  I was driving home yesterday and I go to press the gas, immediately I notice no real response, no boost, and my exhaust note has changed to sound like it has some kinda sputter.  My boost gauge is moving, but can't be right as I have no power.   I pull off, and when the car is idle is really low RPMs, like 700, pressing the gas from this results in a lot of vibration and low power response.    I manage to limp the car home, but something is very wrong.

There is no longer a Fiat dealership in my area, the nearest to me is well over an hour away, I pick a local repair shop with a good reputation, but probably little personal knowledge of my engine.  **Error code P301, no compression in cylinder 1.**   I have them check the coil, the vaccum seal, spark plugs, everything, they even remove the entire intake manifold so they can look at the piston itself.  Everything they attempt, including some kinda ""oil test"" with the piston still results a tiny bit of compression which fades into no compression quickly.   They still haven't been able to actually SEE a problem, everything from the eye looks fine, but...no compression.   They are convinced it has to be something in the bottom of the motor, like the crank or that the rings on the piston might have gone blown.  

They're only advice for repair is replace the engine at this point as they can't find the cause without basically taking the entire engine apart.  

Does ANYONE have any ideas what this could be?  Anything I should have checked that might not have been checked already?  Anything at all?   I'm desperate at this point, I love this car, its not even paid off yet, and I'd like to avoid having to buy a new car so I can get back to work.   Please help.   Thank you.

33,A history of Fiats,Anonysmous,"A subreddit for Fiat, who would have thought it!

I've been driving Fiats for a while. It kind of stopped when I moved to the US from Europe, but now I'm considering buying myself a toy, a used 500 Abarth. The scorpion and I have a bit of history together.

Fiats owned so far:

Fiat 126  
Fiat 127  
Fiat 128 Coupe  
Fiat 124  
Fiat 131  
Fiat Ritmo Abarth Gen. 1  
Fiat Ritmo Abarth Gen. 2  
Fiat Uno Turbo (Abarth had their hand in it, but not their name on it)  
And then lastly, a totally forgettable bland Fiat, I can't even remember the name (Punto?)

With exception of the first and the last, I had a blast with each and every one of them...

As far as the 500 Abarth here in the US, I am doing my research, but is there anything that is a known issue that would make buying the Abarth a deal breaker?

In Sport Mode is less like that, but still happens.  I have not been able to Google much info on this issues, I have found some information that that is normal.  I test drove another 500 Abarth this week, with intake, piggyback and it did that in that car as well.

57,Attempting to put a 2012 Fiat 500 Performance Coolant Reservoir in a 2013 Abarth,WiggaCracker,"There is a difference between the coolant reservoir on the non-turbo models and the turbo models. On my Abarth the mount point where the reservoir slides into a little socket on the firewall but on the non-turbo models that hole is moved to the left and I was curious if there is a different bracket for that mounting point? But I was unable to find pictures or information on if there is a different bracket. If there is I would like to buy it in order to fit the performance tank in my Abarth.

I attached a photo of the non turbo coolant reservoir mount with a arrow pointing to behind the coolant tank at the mounting point? If anyone would be willing to take a picture of the bracket it would be greatly appreciated!

61,"Bit of a weird comparison, but Miata vs 500c?",Maxahoy,"I'm curious to hear people's thoughts. Once I graduate college I'm looking to buy something fun and cheap, and the Miata is the obvious answer. However, two seats is kinda a downer. The 500c still comes with a convertible top, the Abarth is dope, and the 4 seats is a major plus. However, it's got the potential to be far less reliable.

That being said -- an NC Miata in good shape goes for similar prices to a Fiat Abarth in my area, just browsing cars.com and autotrader. Both are compelling, but I've heard so many good things about the Miata and so many bad things about the 500c, especially the convertible top.

65,Multiair Actuator Issue,MelancholyDick,"Howdy!

I drive a ‘13 500 Abarth that just rolled over 36,000 miles. I took it on a road trip this past weekend and the car ran fine the whole time until about halfway through the journey when the check engine light came on. A quick code read at an O’Reilly’s indicates it needs a new variable valve timing actuator. The thing is, the car had been running just fine all day. 

One thing I noticed afterwards is that it takes longer to start in the morning and hesitates to gain power if I leave too soon before the car warms up. This only seems to happen first thing in the morning after it’s been sitting all night. 

I have a few theories as to why the car ultimately runs fine and starts easier the rest of the day:

1. A dud battery (brand new from March this year).

2. Sand or dirt in the engine. I moved from New Mexico down to Florida and I suspect there is a lot of dust in the engine that I don’t quite know how to get out. 

3. Bad sensor. Does it have one? Maybe it just needs a cleaning or replacement?

Also worth noting that sometimes the check engine light disappears. I chalked this up to just a gremlin but maybe it’s worse than that. 

I really hope I don’t need to replace the whole actuator, so hopefully this ends up being minor. 

Have any of you experienced this with your 500? If so, what was the solution?",4,4,0,4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fiat/comments/dfopo1/multiair_actuator_issue/,1570660741.0,dfopo1

Started with a whirring coming from the transmission (throw out bearing dying) and ended with a completely nonfunctional clutch. The cause, at this point, I believe to be a blown input shaft seal, which sprayed the clutch assembly with trans fluid and completely drained the transmission of fluid. Now I must replace the clutch assembly and throw out bearing at a minimum, but I am sure there will be more as I do not yet know the cause of the blown seal.

Financially, this will be really difficult for me, I can barely afford the parts, and I absolutely cannot afford to take it to the dealer, I will have to do this 14 hour job myself. Warranty is out of the question. I guess i'm just looking for advice on the best way to go about doing this, and if there are any options I have to save money. I have already purchased the throw out bearing and proper trans fluid. I will also need the technical walkthroughs if anyone has any, if not, I will purchase them.

115,"Shiny new 124 Abarth owner, have some questions:",binkleyz,"1. Is there any way to disable the nanny mode restrictions on manipulating the infotainment setup while in motion?  Finding lots of things greyed out that I'd rather were not.
2. I frequently carry a backpack heavy enough to set off the passenger seat-belt alarm.  Short of getting one of those cheaters, is there a setting or something that can be done to disable just the passenger seatbelt alert?  My other car is a Subaru, and to get that done there, you need to just lock and unlock the seatbelt 15 times within 30 seconds, so I was hoping there was some magic combo like that.
3. The only badging on the car that says Fiat is on the steering wheel.. can someone point me towards a (quality) replacement badge for that?
4. I've seen a few opinions here, but was wondering if it was safe to use my power washer (on low pressure) to clean the car?  It seems like even brushless car washes are out, so I'm trying to find a way to avoid having to do it all by hand.
5. 87/89/91/93 Octane?  Says ""super recommended"" under the gas door, but not sure how high is truly needed.

Thanks, hope these are not all n00b questions (or at least not annoyingly close to that), and I'll be back here shortly to look for advice on how to wring more HP out of the thing.

133,Electrical issue? 2013 USA Fiat 500 Abarth - front doors speakers & tweeters cutting and out.,hjungj21o,"Hi everyone,

I picked up a 2013 Fiat 500 Abarth (my first manual tranny car!) two weeks ago.The previous owner had installed a new entertainment unit (Pioneer AVH-4200NEX) in lieu of the stock radio unit, as well as a subwoofer in the trunk.Everything was in great working condition during inspection of the car, and I hadn't felt the need to turn on any music until last night while I was doing some late night cruising on the highway... That's when I realized the driver's side speaker and tweeter would cut in and out. Not sure what triggers the sound coming back in. Upon closer inspection, I found that when the driver's side speakers do come in, the passenger side speakers seem to go out so they are alternating cutting in and out (although the passenger side speakers seem to hold onto the sound a little more). My guess is bad wiring during installation of the subwoofer and head unit + the wet, cold conditions of the Northeast US.

The subwoofer is directly behind the driver's side back seat, if that helps. Not the end of the world because I'd rather listen to the exhaust notes when putting around town but it would still bother me during longer drives that I'd have to make from time to time. If you guys had any similar experiences, I'd love to hear about it and what you did to fix the issue before I start contacting dealers/shops around me for a proper diagnosis/quotes for repair. 

Oh, and for a more serious issue - when I do stall the car (still getting used to the car) and turn back on, the airbag check light comes on for 15 seconds, and then goes away. It does not throw that error when I start the car normally, not quickly after stalling. Is this anything serious that I should look into?

&#x200B;

Im looking to get myself a new Fiat 500 2018 but am undecided between a Pop and Abarth. I understand that in the 2018 models, the Pop and Lounge both have turbo now but not at powerful as the Abarth. Would someone be willing to explain the other minute differences in the three models? I dont want to go into the dealer without having an idea and being sold something I dont need. I dont require fancy trimmings or seatings. I dont want a sunroof as I heard that really takes away from headroom. I dont know what the difference between a hatchback and cabrio is. From what I do know, I would think to only decide between a Pop and Abarth unless if the Lounge has something really unique that I mustve missed while comparing the specs on the site.  


&#x200B;

I live in NYC and am looking to alleviate parking pains with the Fiat 500. I want to get an Abarth but is it really worth it to get an Abarth (additional $100/mo on lease according to website) now over a Pop or Lounge that have a turbo for typical use? Is the Turbo in the Pop and Lounge sufficient to not make the car feel sluggish in those times of merging needs. I dont intend to do crazy speeds. Maximum 70MPH if thats the current traffic flow on the freeway. I probably will only be the only one in the car most of the time aside from the occasional girlfriend and even more rare family. Id have 4 seats full maybe a handful of times a year. I want to get automatic transmission for those long rides out of state and to make things easier for my girlfriend if she decides to drive it now and then. Usual commute is a little less than  25miles/day with a mix of highways and local streets (terrible conditions). Im not a speed demon but at the same time i dont want to ever feel buyers remorse in getting the lesser slower model although Ive read here that the older 2013(?) turbo models had the same power as current 2018 Pop/Lounge. I currently (share) drive a 2016 Honda FIT and want to get a car for my OWN. Any input is appreciate!

I have a 16GB FAT32 formatted USB stick that I use to listen to music in my car. It's a Fiat 500 Abarth.  


I added some music (27 songs) last week and everything went smoothly, the car player read everything perfectly. However, yesterday, I added 8 other songs and only one is being recognized by my car player. So, instead of displaying 35 songs as it does on my laptop, the car is displaying 28 of them. I don't understand. I thought maybe that the bitrate of those last 7 songs was too high for the car player but it doesn't add up since the one song that the car plays has a 128 bitrate, just like some of the songs that the player doesn't read.

177,"Decision-wise, how much weight do you put in a manual?",ChulaK,"So I've been looking around for my first car (and my dream car at that), and I've been torn between ND Miata or the 124 Spider. I've been more towards the Miata because of the many options already available in the used market with GT/Club trims already being listed at sub-$20k USD.

The *right* 124 Spider is just harder to find, especially that it has a lot more variations. The more options it has, the more rare it is to find especially here in the US. I actually found one with my dream configuration: Abarth, LED lights (hard to find *with* Abarth trim), white with heritage stripe (which is even *more* rare to find here in US), *zomg red leather seats!!*... automatic. Sure it doesn't have the red front lip or mirror caps like the Euro spec'd Abarths but this comes pretty damn close. Those are easy fixes anyway.

It is a deal breaker? I'm a patient man and I can wait. If a car had your dream configuration but was an automatic, would you turn away?

I'm really struggling with this one and I really don't want to succumb to the automatic. The main reason for choosing the 124 Spider over the Miata was that reviews say it's a better ride, more sound deadening. I live out in the suburbs where it's mostly residential and highways and felt like I would just be torturing myself in the long run if I had the Miata mostly out in the highways vs the 124 Spider which is more of a truer GT cruiser. I'm also out in the Northeast so the top will be up for a good portion of the year.

I had this creeping thought in my head that *maybeeee* the automatic wouldn't be too bad? I was watching reviews of the automatic still being able to do burnouts.

182,Sensible Mods For A 2015 Abarth,abel1389,"I posted this over at r/Abarth as well, but figured I might get a wider response here.

So I’ve recently bought a used 2015 Abarth (auto), damn near new, and I’m not expecting issues right off the bat. I’ve read quite a few people say they tend to fall apart a little easy, but that most of the typical issues can usually be either fixed or outright avoided with some aftermarket work. Since it’s been a goal of mine to learn the ins and outs of my car anyway, I figured this could, in the long run, become a good learning experience.

This has got me looking around trying to figure out what kinds of mods and part replacements would actually be useful and practical to consider and eventually invest in. I’m not looking to try to get 250+ HP or anything crazy out of it; just looking for wrench time and part swaps that could be put in that would improve reliability, fuel economy, etc... You know, the useful daily stuff. I drive it hard on city streets, but don’t tend to speed by much, and I don’t usually break 90 on a freeway unless it’s just totally empty. So what would be some things to look at, or at least plan on dealing with eventually?

186,I just bought a 2015 FIAT 500 Abarth.,Doooshty,"I came from a 2006 G35 sedan, which had many more options, even bring 9 years older. It was faster. Had more seat room. The build quality is cheap on the Fiat. Lots of low quality plastic. A piece of the trim is disintegrating. 

I don't care. 

It's been a long time since I had a car that caused me to be legitimately sad because I had to go to work and couldn't drive it. I had the urge to go outside on my lunch just to listen to the exhaust. The Abarth is FAR from the perfect car. It's perfect where it matters to me though. Maybe over long term, years of dealing with it that will change but for now I absolutely adore this tiny little Italian. I got it at a substantial amount off because it sat on the lot forever I'm pretty sure it had to do with the fact that the previous owner had custom pink and black leather katzkin seat covers installed.

I have an odd question about brakes but I’m sure it’s a common one? I’m looking to upgrade my brakes to drilled and slotted rotors and ceramic pads. What should this cost? Short of going full Brembo(2k+), I’m just curious. 
I found a set of what I’m looking for on BrakePerformance for like $250. Reviews seem to be positive on the individual set as well as the site as a whole. This is a bit cheaper than I’ve seen on more specialty sites like 500madness which are around $500 and up to $800 for pads and rotors. Seeing as the reviews are good for both products, should I have any issues going for the $250 set? I should mention that all the information I found on drilled and slotted rotors like chamfering the holes is done on the cheaper option as well and a lifetime warranty for warping and cracking, I can’t see an immediate reason why they’re so much cheaper. 
On the installation front, what should I be looking at? I have no idea on what labor should cost, but the Big O that has been the nicest to me and my car said they’ll install brakes I buy myself because they don’t carry any drilled etc for the 500 Abarth I drive. How much should that cost? If anyone has any shop recommendations etc as well let me know.

thanks!

Currently I have a 07 vw mkv gti with the following mods..

156k miles

apr stage 1 tuning

koni orange struts

oem+ springs

neuspeed cai

10in sub in trunk

backup camera

pioneer touchscreen headunit

I am starting to have problems with the gti such as on a cold start the turbo? is making a strange noise when pressure is release. almost sounds like grinding gears if the noise was produced by air.

bent wheel, not related but causing major vibration throughout vehicle making dash rattle worse than normal and cruising at 70 feels like i'm fighting to stay in the lane. 

3 seconds without holding the steering wheel im half way in the other lane. alignment or just bent wheel?

right axle may need to be replaced. not sure on that because I had taken it to a garage due to the left axle needing to be replaced and they said the right will probably be next.

Abs speed sensor driver side needs to be replaced. Abs and tc aren't working currently. 

fear of turbo blowing. I don't rag on the car too much, but certainly give the go every so often just to remind myself its a fun car.

but  that might be the problem. i've had it for about 5 years now and I'm looking for something else.

Money is kind of tight, so if I could sell the gti or trade it in and get a car with lower mileage and is newer I might avoid headache in the future. 

I am considering the following..

13-14(prefer 14) fiat abarth. 

size isn't a problem. my gti is the 2 door, its just my girlfriend and I, not often driving friends. my back seat hasn't been used in minimum 10 months. 

I mainly drive highway (55-85mph) about an 1.5 hours/day. but I live in the mountains and have plenty of curvy road options home. 

we do get a lot of snow but that's not that bad. I'd get snow tires and I usually don't drive in any more than 3 inches or stay home. worse case take the gf's awd suv that has snows.

I'm looking at a few that are 2013 abarth $9500 44k miles. I'd prefer a 2014, but I haven't seen many under $12. 

The fiesta st is also another one. Idk about how fun compared to the abarth. probably more reliable and makes more sense. However I can't really find many under $12k. 2014 $12900 51k miles. I mean maybe if I could talk them down to even $12. but that might be stretching it. 

focus st is slightly more than the fiesta as well.

I wouldn't mind a speed3, but finding one in the condition I want has proven to be difficult. 

then there's another gti. again.. fun factor I guess . I found a 2012 for just under $10 with 69k miles. base models, but heated seats. 

If I went gti I feel like I would just end up trying to re-mod it to what I have currently. whereas the abarth comes essentially modded from the factory. 

any other suggestions?

I'm taking the gti to get the wheels fixed this weekend so hopefully that helps the major vibrations.  

Then I'll take it to the garage and have them poke around and see if anything major is wrong and to check out the right axle, check alignment...?

maybe fixing my gti will scratch whatever itch i've got cause don't get me wrong I do like my gti, it makes the best turbo noises and is great around the corners, passing on the highway or just crusing. but my last two cars seemed to have been the ""sensible choice"" mazda3 2.3l, gti.

202,"considering a used 2013-14 500 Abarth, looking for input",rajethesta,"Hey all

 so currently I have a 07 vw mkv gti with the following mods..

apr stage 1 tuning

koni orange struts

oem+ springs

neuspeed cai



however it is starting to get old and up there in mileage so I was looking at my options 

The fiat 500 abarth seems really well priced as I found some that were around $9.5-$10.5 with 20-30k miles which is in my price range.



**my concerns** would be I mainly drive highway (55-85mph) about an 1.5 hours/day.

How does the 500 abarth deal with cruising at 80mph? I know the stock exhaust is rather loud and I would be concerned about droning with only being a 5 speed.

my gti I almost never hear the exhaust unless I'm really high in the rpm. I hear my turbo more than anything which i love.



**The other concern** would be how it handles in the snow.

I live in an area where it snows a decent amount but have always had snow tires; i'd consider no different if I had the fiat.

I have 4 blizzak snow tires on my gti currently and do not have much problem in the snow within reason.



Thanks for the input.

206,Odd Question about Bilstein Coilovers on a 500 Abarth,Leo_brooks,"Hi!
I bought a 500 Abarth about 6 months ago and have put about 8k Miles on it while living in the city (come on it just begs to be driven) and was recently in the shop replacing a headlight (I know I know I should do myself and save some money) and one of the techs saw my suspension and said wow I have that in my car it’s amazing and said that it’s a 3k coilover situation. I knew it had modded suspension and was lowered but I never asked what it was besides what brand and was it reliable. 
The obvious answer is that it is Bilstein B16s available on 500 madness (https://shop.500madness.com/fiat-500-abarth-cid114/suspension-and-brakes-cid121/suspension-upgrades-cid267/fiat-500-coilover-kit-by-bilstein-b16-pss10-adjustable-north-american-model-pid3413) but I noticed the B14s for a third of the price. (https://shop.500madness.com/fiat-500-abarth-cid114/suspension-and-brakes-cid121/suspension-upgrades-cid267/fiat-500-coilover-kit-by-bilstein-b14-pss-north-american-version-pid2103) Is it possible that I have B14s and how would I differentiate them? And perhaps more importantly, what is the actual difference between the two? A quick search shows that the 16s are adjustable (being coilovers I assume that means adjusting the coil height with a wrench etc.) why can’t that be done with the 14s though? 
I’m a noob in this world, and would love an actual explanation and not just criticism for either spending 3k on something that is the same as a 1k solution even though I wasn’t the one spending it or buying a car without knowing what modded suspension it has. Oh and if you couldn’t tell from the links Im in the US and my car is a 2014. Thanks

Tl/dr: what’s the difference between bilstein B16s and B14s for a 500 Abarth and how justifiable is a 200% increase in price?

207,Abarth/Turbo Shopping,r_dawson_25,"Hi! I'm new here and I wanted to ask some Fiat owners a few questions in regards to buying a second hand North American (Canadian specifically) Fiat 500 Abarth or Turbo, and what kind of reliability/problems I can expect.

First off, I drive on average about an hour, twice a day, 4 times a week (about 80km a day) so I will be clocking a fair bit of mileage. I also need the car to last me at minimum 4 years because I'm buying a condo in a few months won't be able to afford a new car any time soon. This limits my budget to about $12,000 CAD which isn't a lot, but there are a few options available for me. 

For the turbo's I'm a bit spoiled for choice as the average mileage is between 40-60,000km (25-37,000 miles) for ones in my price range, but for the Abarth, only 2012-2013's are available, and all the options I have are over 100,000km (62000 miles)! For obvious reasons I would prefer an Abarth, but will settle for the turbo if necessary. I'm just concerned with reliability. My GF has had a 500 now for 4 years and it has been relatively problem free, but she only drives in town and its never more than 5 or 6 minutes on the road. Not sure how well these vehicles would hold up to the amount of driving I do, especially with higher mileage models. 

TL:DR Want to buy an abarth/turbo but high mileage and reliability is a concern. Would like to hear real world opinions from owners before I pull the trigger. 

Thanks everyone, and sorry for the long post.

1) How's the reliability? I know its essentially a Miata with the 1.4 multi-air. But, there seems to be speculation that Fiat may be scaling down operatings at the very least in the US. Is this reason enough to avoid buying one?

2) I cant seem to find a 2017 anywhere near me. I'd likely have to fly out of state to pick one up. Are these cars really that rare?

3) Would I be jumping the gun if I were to buy this summer, as opposed to January 2019 when the 2019s come out? I'd like the price to be close as possible to $20k. I'm not sure if an extra 7 months or so would make a huge difference.

My trouble is I am super cheap and commitment phobic so I tend to not often finance my cars.  I have decided it may be the time to do so and I have several Abarths in my  scope but don't know which to pull the trigger on.

I see some 2016 models that are leftover that have decent prices on them, one nearby has 1k miles on it which seems high for a ""new"" car.
I see several used 2013 models from 8k to 13k and some around 10.5k that have around 25k to 45k miles on them.  

The frugal part of me says buy an older one, save 10 grand and cross your fingers nothing major breaks.  The sensible side says get a new one, get the peace of mind of a warranty and just pay now so you don't pay later in larger chunks.

UGH, what to do? Also wondered if there is any breakdown on colors, I see a lot of a few colors but hardly see any in certain ones. Is there some more rare or were they just more popular then others? 

I am sure I will have more questions later.
