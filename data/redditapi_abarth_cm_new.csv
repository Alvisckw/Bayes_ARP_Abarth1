4,volttage,juyjkeg,t3_15j8dsw,15j8dsw,"If manual: make sure clutch feels good, nice and smooth take up window, if it takes up really high or suddenly it wasn?€?t treated well and is worn out. Pay attention to noises when activation clutch pedal, also a sign it needs clutch/bearing.

On test drive: get into 5th on a quiet street, pop it out of gear and coast. Listen to the rear of the vehicle. If there is a whirling or growling noise, it needs rear wheel bearings. 

Try and peak through both front wheels. See if you can see grease on either frame rail or on the wheels themselves. They are notorious for failed CV boots. 

Engines are tough to tell if they have been treated nice. Best way is to pull oil cap, and check what color the top of the multi-air brick looks like. If it?€?s bronzed or darker colored, or you don?€?t see nice clean parts on top, it?€?s oil changes weren?€?t done often enough. I?€?m apparently on the long end of the service interval people change oil on these cars (6-8000mi interval) but mine still looked clean. It can also be an indicator of the quality of oil used at oil changes. Clean parts = good oil/low interval. Dark colored dirty parts = cheap oil/long interval. 

That?€?s all that comes to mind. I?€?ll probably think of something later.",1691275930,4
5,MetalMattyPA,juyksyf,t3_15j8dsw,15j8dsw,"Put it in Sport mode and do a (safe) pull in third gear or higher. Stock boost pressure in Sport mode is 18PSI. 

If the turbo intake noise is exceptionally loud and/or it only hits 10-15psi consistently in Sport mode, there is potentially a boost leak at the intercooler. Not crazy uncommon because FCA used stupid ass spring clips to hold the intercooler hoses to the pipes instead of clamps like the rest of the world.

The factory boost gauge is a boost request gauge, but when I had a bad boost leak it read exactly the same as my mechanical boost gauge did, so should be a decent enough gauge of boost pressure.",1691276449,2
6,VonEssen,juyoahu,t3_15j8dsw,15j8dsw,"I??ve owned a 2013 Abarth (135hp) now for 6-7 years. Only thing that has broken was the control-unit for the gauge-cluster (the lights and text in the gauge-cluster starts blinking and acting funny, I have videos of it on youtube), had to send the instrument in for a new chip and that cost total $550. Apart from that the only things that has failed is the front door-handle-hinges. They are about $12 a piece and pretty easy to change yourself. 

That??s it for 6-7 years!

Also worth noting is that spare parts are dirt cheap and there are tons of step-by-step tutorials on youtube on how to service, change breaks and alot of other maintenance-things.

When you test-drive it dont be afraid of putting it in sport-mode and thrash it around. You shouldn??t hear any weird sounds except for the awesome exhaust-note. =)",1691277942,1
7,JohnathanGower,jv08rue,t3_15j8dsw,15j8dsw,"45K miles...there shouldn't be any real issues if it's been taken care of by the previous owner and/or the selling dealer.  That said....

If manual, clutch should be fairly easy with a catch point somewhere around 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up and shifter should be super easy.  I've never had to replace a clutch in mine, but did have to replace the shift cables...however, there was no warning when mine failed...things just didn't shift right and I barely made it to the shop.

Always drive in sport mode. Throttle response is only right in sport. Shift light (for economy purposes) is disabled in sport mode, so it won't light up.

Boost gauge should fly all over the place during any drive with varying speeds/shifts.  If it DOESN'T move and seems to bog down or stick in one place, there could be a problem.

When going over bumps at low speeds, pay attention to any knocks seemingly from the engine or transmission.  Also feel for knocks when shifting between gears at low speed.  When you're in gear and maintaining speed, coasting and tapping the gas pedal to do so, do you hear any clunks or knocks? The lower motor/torque mounts wear out/brake on these.

Roll both windows up and down a couple times. Listen/look for any loud pops or other noises.  Regulator and related window problems, I've heard, are common on these.

If you're a confident enough driver, find a good stretch of road where you can get up to speed and put the car in neutral...so you can hear if the wheel bearings are going bad.  It can be hard to hear the roar of bad wheel bearings over the Abarth's exhaust if you're not used to it.  I've had to get a couple wheel bearings replaced.

Make sure you check that the hatch works.  Sounds dumb, but it's easy to forget the simple things sometimes. I've heard hatch latches are a common fail on Abarths, though mine still works fine.

If you have a code reader, take it and use it.  It's super common for this car to have the check engine light come and go...but a good reader can tell you if there are any codes pending or current and sometimes, depending on the reader, past codes. Also, if the codes have been cleared so the engine light is off, a reader will often still give you the codes.

My 2013 Abarth has about 90,000 on the clock and mechanically feels like a remarkably solid car.",1691310047,1

It sounds like you have a major boost leak, running the engine won't do the car any good. 

You won't see anything underneath as your cas has 2 small intercoolers located on the left and right side, hidden by the bumper. 

When I replaced my 2 small intercoolers for a one big one, all the connections were a bitch to take off, so it's surprising something popped off at only 10k miles. 

Take it to a mechanic or dealer, it could be as simple as a single hose coming off, and unless you know where to look don't worry about it now. It's quite tight underneath the bonnet. 

Best of luck

324,Kooky-Caramel7376,jti6tdi,t1_jthqyqo,159x4zm,"Ok, yes, it's definitely not a mechanic/pneumatic gauge (like a normal turbo gauge with a hose connected to the intake manifold), the input is electrical but :   
\- Is it ECU boost value thinks it's getting from a pressure (map) sensor (this what I meant by actual boost) ?   
or   
\- Is it pressure requested (aka boost target) from the ECU ?   


It's 2 differents things. To simplify I just wanted to know if a boost leak will be visible on the gauge.  
If it's strictly based on requested boost (like most people says), it means that the stock gauge could show 1.2 bar as soon as I WOT while producing 0 bar for example. (If I WOT the ECU will instantly request x amount of pressure depending on temperature/load and other factors).

However, if it's a value taken from a sensor, and assuming the sensor is working correctly, if I disable the turbo, it will stay at 0. 

I may try to disable boost by disconnecting the vaccum hose at the wastegate and see if the boost gauge just acts like if I still have boost or not.

What made me confused (citation) :  


>As for the factory gauge, it was a big topic of misunderstanding when the Abarth came out. It's actually accurate, however it's displaying the ""Throttle Inlet Pressure"", which is a fairly Chrysler-specific sensor that measures charge tube pressure after the intercooler but before the throttle body. It is NOT indicative of intake manifold pressure, but an indication of possible or available pressure in the boost tube. Chrysler's ECU have been using such a sensor for decades, and not surprisingly, nobody else has adopted the strange strategy.",1690367344,1
325,Taco_Nights,jthl6qk,t3_159tqss,159tqss,"I'm actually working on installing one myself into my US 2013. It's a used early 2015 Blue&Me TFT. 

It works... Changing byte 65 to 20, 40, or 60 all does the same thing. There is a font and minor graphics change, but no fancy Abarth splash screen. Changing byte 65 to 00 gives a different font and graphics but again just the ""500"" stylized splash screen.

On all, pressing the sport button gives the right hand side a throttle position reading which doesn't work. That I knew going in so no biggie. But what I was looking for is the Turbo style that has the boost gauge there instead.

The other oddity I have to look into, is now I have a TPMS error and they won't populate on the screen as they should. Which isn't a huge deal as I've been driving for decades without TPMS and can certainly manage fine without. Just be nice for it to work like it should.

The only way I've had the Abarth splash screen show up is by changing the engine within MES. Picking the 1.4 16V Turbo made the Abarth screen show, but created a new bunch of errors, such as hill assist, ECS, ABS being absent according to the dash.

I've tried both AlfaOBD and multiecuscan. I'm going to work on it some more thus week as I'm still learning both programs. They both have different ways of doing certain things and maybe I can find a way to make it work. 

I have a 2013 US model Abarth, manual HVAC, no sunroof and have installed an aftermarket radio because Blue&Me sucks donkey balls.",1690350853,2
326,Taco_Nights,ju02xn2,t3_159tqss,159tqss,"So I've been playing with this, using both Multiecuscan and AlfaOBD, with little luck so far. I too purchased mine from a UK supplier, and I'm not entirely sure that one from the EU works properly in a NA car. I've read a couple of folks used EU versions in NA cars with success. 

I honestly don't care much about having the Abarth splash screen. There are enough reminders all over the car of what I'm driving, one missing doesn't hurt my feelings. 

What I'd like to work is the TPMS (sorta), and I'd like the boost gauge on the right side of the cluster from the Turbo 500 version. That I haven't seen yet in any of the iterations I've managed to get. So far it's always ECO or GAS % depending if the sport button is engaged or not. 

The ""G"" meter I know won't work. 

For me changing byte 65 does nothing unless it's 00. 

I'm trying to decide if I just leave it as is or play more. I like the look more than the original gauge enough that the TFT not being ""perfect"" is fine with me. But I have a real bad problem with leaving things well enough. It would be nice if the person/group making Multiecuscan would let the world know what each byte in the proxi changes. Or at least what each does, that they know of. 

Otherwise I'll just keep an eye out for an NA version. I don't care about the mileage. When or if I sell the car I'll stuff the original back in and update it's mileage. It's just tough to find an early Blue&Me version, but maybe if the price is right I'll live with the UConnect version.

355,New-Egg-8432,jte2up8,t1_jtdbt7g,15952kk,Ohhhh,1690296556,1
356,BigTurboAbarth,jtddzrt,t1_jtdddoy,15952kk,It will still oxidize just at a much slower rate. Plasti-dip is porous so oxygen can still make its way to the aluminum to oxidize it,1690284899,2
357,MetalMattyPA,jtdeagh,t1_jtdddoy,15952kk,"As Turbo said, it'll still oxidize underneath. The plastidip will just make it look a little less bad. It'll just be an appearance thing. 

You'll still be able to see the oxidation marks under the plastidip but it'll be a lot more hidden than leaving it open. 

Unfortunately the only *real* solution is to refinish the wheels, but fortunately outside of it looking bad there isn't really any negative side effects. The only one that's really possible is if the oxidation starts around the bead (where the tire seats to the wheel) it can cause small leaks that require the tire to be dismounted, the wheel cleaned, and the tire remounted.",1690285078,2

366,Dexter713_dfn,jtam1le,t3_158kalv,158kalv,So I?€?ve heard some ppl have to disconnect the battery for over an hour for it to actually reset the ECU. The starting issue sounds like your battery might be on its last leg cuz I had something similar when my battery was almost dead and my grounding wire to the ECU had become so brittle it snapped. So I would check the battery and the extra grounding wires to it for issues. The other issues could be related if say the ECU was getting an uneven amount of power and was no longer grounded it could be causing random electrical issues,1690230072,3
367,irescueducks,jtk5qre,t3_158kalv,158kalv,"Replaced the battery two days ago, everything is back to normal. ECU is behaving like a decent citizen, engine starts up right away, feels like new.

I've driven it about a year and a half (I do about 35k a year mixed stop and go delivery miles).  So far I've rebuilt the axles, replaced the shift cables, replaced two wheel bearings, and replaced a lower engine/torque mount...aside from regular oil changes, brakes, tires, etc. It requires more repairs than my previous Toyotas and Hondas...but not by much.  Also, being a high performance version of a ""regular"" car, parts are much cheaper than high performance parts for ""luxury"" or ""sporty"" marques (like Mini, BMW, Mercedes, etc).  You'll need to find a mechanic who is willing to look at it with an open mind.  These are NOT hard to work on, but being unusual, they carry an initial aura of ""foreign-ness"" that freak some mechanics out.  I believe, based on my experience, that these are pretty robust cars.  The unibody structure, suspension, and drivetrain are solid--actually exceptionally well designed and put together.  Even most of the ""cheap"" interior trim is pretty well done.  The shift knob, shift boot, stereo buttons, mirror flags, steering column shroud and various other odd pieces are cheap and tend to wear out quickly, but they're small potatoes.

610,Drew2248,jrrbsln,t3_14y6mjf,14y6mjf,"I don't one one, but any ""highly-stressed"" car like a Fiat Abarth is going to require more attention than most other cars, and a lot more attention than, say, a Toyota or a Honda. You need to check the oil regularly, and change the oil far more often than on other cars. You could probably change the oil on a Toyota Corolla every 8-10K miles, which is not at all ideal, and have it run for hundreds of thousands of miles without much trouble. With a Fiat Abarth, it would be a very different story. That schedule would undoubtedly do damage to the engine. 

On these cars, various parts and ""systems"" will fail more often than on other cars due to their cheap build quality. You'll have to change or fix a lot of things over time while your Toyota friends will barely have to do that except for normal wear and tear items and only every few years. 

Finding servicing on a Toyota or Honda is drop dead easy since any mechanic will know them. For Fiats, servicing is not easy to find, and if your mechanic stinks, you won't have many (or any) other choices. 

Resale value will not be very high, so you will lose money on all the servicing and repairs required, then you'll lose even more money on the trade-in or resale. Why don't more people buy beautiful old Jaguars? Because they would go bankrupt keeping them going. Your Fiat Abarth is not going to bankrupt you, by any means, but it will be a bit of a pain in the ass at times, and you may need to get used to damaged interior parts and hard-to-fiind service parts, and other issues with the car.

Replaced MA brick at 105k, at 30psi of boost it finally failed and started spraying oil out the back. So I replaced it. 

Oil changes every 5k, plugs ever 20k, I changed the MA filter at 75k, it was clean. 5w40 penzoil, aka the oem recommended oil. I've done a lot of maintenance,  and that's a key factor in reliability. It was a daily driver til 6 months ago, now it's more a weekend car. 

Motor mounts, wheel bearings, and struts like to be replaced around 75k. Proper mods and maintenance mean the car runs well and doesn't break down. I travel cross country in this car 2 or 3 times a year. Tires are uncommon and hard to find.

782,PeetTreedish,jra5xtu,t1_jra3ak2,14uxts2,The ac system cycles on and off for economic reasons and emissions. Usually when the car is sitting idle at a light or in a lot. The clutch on the ac compressor disengages and the air coming out will get warm. Then you set off again and the ac starts back up. Also sitting at a light with the ac running causes the engine to run faster. This burns fuel and creates more pollution. This is common with many new vehicles.,1688914194,0

786,PeetTreedish,jra9f0i,t1_jra7ngh,14uxts2,The radiator fan doesn't do that. There is a motor in the dash that pulls air over a smaller radiator. Freon cycles through that radiator and back out to the ac condenser. Then the freon expands and releases heat off that condenser and back to the compressor and then back through the dash. The big fan on the radiator under the hood only activates when the coolant in the engine gets too hot. The engine running hotter be cause the ac is on and the big fan running is more of a engineered coincidence.,1688915720,-1

What I found out did not surprise me at all - On tight twisties/challenging tracks with super nice corners I was a bit faster, more aggressive but at the same time more composed/consistent with the automatic BUT in semi-automatic mode using the paddle shifters.

And it kinda makes sense. Yes, the automatic mode is a bit dense, but I am not able to change gears faster and better with the manual, than the semi-auto mode. Plus you don't have to take your hands of the wheel. The not so wide pedalbox with 3 pedals combined with the Sabelt seats is just to tight for me, it feels super weird and a bit annoying.  


So for the sake of more composure in the top end AND possibility to just lay back, relax and enjoy the snail-mode (city traffic, scorpio-go-home-mode after a hard day in the corners, etc.) - I would go with the automatic, Brembo, Koni, lowered Sabelt seats.

Don?€?t judge the the MTA on a short test drive - I thought it was terrible at first but bought it anyway figuring Abarth can?€?t be wrong. After a week or so I got used to when it was going to shift up or down and no longer hate it.

When accelerating hard, it sometimes refuses to shift up when you?€?ve reached the road?€?s speed limit as it?€?s still anticipating you to use the rest of the rev range. A tap on the gear up paddle and you?€?re fine. In fact, I tend to use the paddles just to kick-down before accelerating or after accelerating and leave the auto mode to shift appropriately.

My mom has a 6.4l challenger and the auto in that does a very good job, the car being so quick that I think having both hands on the wheel is worth giving up the manual. 

I only briefly drove an auto Abarth and really didn?€?t enjoy it - it felt like a loud commuter car with a little bit more umph. On the other hand the manual actually feels like a driver?€?s car and is genuinely fun to drive. I personally wouldn?€?t recommend the auto unless at some point they changed them to a good DCT. If in a big city with constant traffic I can see the argument for one, but honestly at that point I?€?d just look for a Honda Fit or something similar and get a more practical car with a negligible increase in footprint. If never going for a spirited drive in the hills or a track there isn?€?t a hell of a lot to gain over the base 500 for stop and go commute, other than the sweet exhaust note. 

Whatever you go for, you need to use sport mode. I?€?ve never been in a car that it made so much of a difference, but in regular my Abarth feels like a loud shitbox whereas the change in boost PSI and throttle mapping makes it feel like a true sports car.

Another option is to uncover the wire loom, remove the part of the wire that's ruined, and splice in a new piece of wire. Also a common fix, but there are arguments on how the spliced bit should be joined.

not really, but my point is this:  thats something id never buy for that price despite how in love with this car i am.  its fun to drive--end.  END.  its not practical compared to other cars and its not necessarily comfortable compared to others either.  this car truly is ""the most smiles per mile"" though.  you *will* be having a better time than anyone on the road driving it; but im tellin ya..i got my 2016 abarth with 23,500 miles on it for $15,000...that was december 2017...its true i wouldnt sell mine now that i own it because i really do love the car that much; but now that it seems these cars have gone up in price quite a bit id probably get something else...like 15k for 23k miles and it was only 1 year old you know?  you're considering a 9 year old car with 76000 miles for 12k...  


i want to emphasize this...if you buy it, you will probably fall in love because you already know about this car.  im not trying to just rain on the parade here, but another thing to consider is that 30% of the abarth owners (in usa at least) end up having some kind of major issue.. my biggest issue was a pretty well known one at this point..the exhaust valve for cylinder 3 had chipped from being burnt so badly..i lost power and had to have the engine head rebuilt almost entirely...so the car runs great now i love it, but i was part of that 30% and until it happens you really wont know what your fate will be :P  hopefully you're part of the 70% that had no major issues...  


my abarth needed new door handles, new purge solenoid, fixed sideskirt that started to come off, replaced the rear sway bar because the clamps on the oem one went bad, replaced turbo, rebuilt cylinder head...so now you add that up now i have significantly more into this car BUT its all good now all the wrongs were righted and its been great...just might want to consider this.   its a GREAT weekend toy or whatever..a side thing you have fun with when you wanna have a good time driving...its not the best daily thats just the truth.  considering the price that i got with the mileage i got..idk if id buy one today for 12k and 76000 miles *and* its 9 years old already..thats just me.  again, though, if you do it i hope you are in the 70% with no major issues and youll just simply fall in love with the car with no serious negative experiences :P  it really is the most smiles per mile..",1687630469,1

1426,CagedGarden,jopeh9j,t3_14civb4,14civb4,I bought a new 595 in 2020 and I can?€?t stress how important it is to be diligent with your checkups. Small turbos need regular maintenance especially if you drive them hard so make sure you look at his service history. timing belt is also very very important. It can be pricey job depending where you live in Italy so make sure it?€?s been done if you?€?re buying an older model. Also check every bit of plastic on the interior to see if they?€?re cracked or if they rattle while driving. Yes it?€?s important cause hearing tiny cracks in the plastics will drive you mad in the long run. E vedi se il tipo ha fatto qualche modifica al motore che in Italia si fa di tutto a queste macchine. Good luck!,1687183579,1

1430,Calm_Logic9267,jomyyn5,t1_jomw0s4,14civb4,"In the US these days, you can often see the service history recorded on Carfax.

Also, use a capable scanner to pull all codes. 

Then there's old school observation.  Does a dipstick look clean, or show signs of baked on oil.  Same with oil cap, clean or signs of sludgey build up.  Are the oil, coolant and brake fluids the correct colors?  Or looking old and tired. Are the battery terminals nice and clean?  Does the engine itself look clean and maintained, or covered in a layer of crud like that hood rarely gets lifted.

If you can be allowed to put a wrench in there, check the air filter.  Pop the intake off and look for blowby oil residue.

Peek at struts, boots, brake pads, etc.

And the little things.  A guy with fresh wiper blades and topped off wiper fluids and a vacuumed interior is probably a guy sharp about maintenance all the way around.

Likewise, the guy with bald tires, scratched up rims, and Monster energy drink spilled all over his console is almost certainly the same guy skipping or stretching service intervals.",1687127568,2

Sounds odd, but don't rush to give the car more power with a remap too soon; instead, invest in a really good set of front tyres (seriously) and put on some after market pads to give the brakes more bite so you can enjoy pushing the breaking points later etc but still only going standard stock speeds

2174,PeetTreedish,jm3mboz,t1_jm2j2qa,13u88c9,"Its all variations of the same thing. One look on Mopar website will tell you what you need to know. They still sell the upgrades. So if you didn't have a sub and amp for the factory stereo. One could be added. Except for the Beats. You can add the same gear they use, but you cant upload their algorithm for the DSP they use to get their sound.

OEM stereos are not some magical thing installed by Dr Dre or B&O or JBL or anyone except the people that make the vehicles. They put in whatever brand of speaker that fits the price point. Then they hire some company to come out and use their DSPing to get the sound they are known for. Then they bake that into all the stereos they sell with that premium brands name on it. McIntosh doesn't make car speakers. Clarion did. JBL doesn't make speakers. VIFA,Peerless, and TYMPHANY did. Now Samsung owns all that. So your JBL/INFINITY/MERIDIAN and others are all made by Samsung.

Yes a full system upgrade is the way to go. You can look on [Crutchfield.com](https://Crutchfield.com) tosee what fits the factory door and tweeter location. Sub is a personal choice. Not much space for a big box. Most people would grab a JL shallow 10"" in a sealed box and be more than happy with that. There isn't much space to fill. So you really don't have to go overboard.",1685384571,2

Auto manufacturers still didnt really care about how the stereos sounded in cars. Bose really showed the world there could be decent OEM sound. In the mid 90s there was a merge of car audio and OEM audio. Fujitsu Ten brought Eclipse into the market and showed the world what an OEM Company could do if the decided to do aftermarket also. Some of the aftermarket brands realized they were going to lose money to OEM is they didn't join in. So now there are a bunch of premium audio labels on OEM cars. But then the guys making the stuff arent either of the companies represented on the vehicle. Pioneer,Sony,Kicker and others still make the speakers.",1685402068,2

2225,PeetTreedish,jlkx14q,t3_13rcdvz,13rcdvz,Im pretty jealous of the amount of choice you guys have. Mostly we are paying for weight and type of casting/forging they use. The name can play a big part too. Ronal is a major producer of OEM wheels. They started out making aftermarket wheels. Now you would have a hard time finding a car without OEM wheels made by them. They own Speedline and they make their aftermarket stuff. Either one of those would be fine. Not really into the Speedline stuff. O.Z. racing is good. Japan Racing makes some nice stuff. A little heavier than I want. But I am not racing so it doesn't matter really. Also if you can find a local shop that can bore out the lug holes on a blank hub. Any wheel that is 4x100 can be drilled to 4x98. So this opens more options. And a set of wobble bolts will let you use 4x100 wheels. those are much more common and cheaper. You could get the rims you want for less than the rims you would have to buy because they are already 4x98. And they jacked up the price for it.,1685031077,2

2227,abarth2014,jli935n,t3_13r1kxx,13r1kxx,"Here is a top tip when it comes to Abarth batteries that are in decline: When you park, allow the engine to idle for 30 seconds or more before you turn off the ignition. When you do this, the ECM will not run the auxiliary water pump after the ignition is turned off (it is that humming noise coming from the passenger side). The pump routes coolant to the turbo and drains the battery. The electric pump can run for more than two minutes and draws about 7-10 amps after the key is removed. By allowing the oil to cool the turbo, it is more effective than the coolant. 

Try it next time you have completed a drive cycle of more than 10 minutes and the coolant is below 200 degrees F.",1684977344,3

This time, the technician couldn't get his computer to connect via OBDII - it kept failing to handshake. Eventually, it connected and showed failure in loads of systems. That's when the guy realised the likely root cause for all the issues: **Gearbox Earth Strap failure**.

He couldn't fit me in for ages, so I agreed to take a look to see if I could spot any problems with the earth strap. Without a ramp I couldn't get to the gearbox side of the strap (the MTA layout is different), but from the top and wheel arch, I could see that the strap was actually in good shape with no corrosion. However, I did find slight corrosion around the lug and bolt holding the strap to the body and also a bit of corrosion around the negative terminal clamp of the battery.

\- Starting to loose power at high RPM (this can be indicative of a bad map)

\- Door handles, give 'em a propper hard slam as the hinges will inevitably fall off

\- Uneven rear tire wear. I've seen a few 500s where a negative camber alignment on the rear wheels causes uneven wear and if it's still all stock suspension, will cost you tyres in the long run

\- Tyres. My Abarth ate through the budget tyres I had on when I brought mine and verrrryyy quickly showed wear because I drive in a spirited manner 

\- A flashing odometer. This can happen when a custom stereo has been fitted and there is a canbus error. I've read this is repareable at a dealer with reprogramming

\- Shifter feeling loose in certain gears. Sometimes the cords snap and need fixing.

This was ten days after I bought it, so lemon laws were in place and I paid for a zero dollar deductible repair plan for it.

The dealership was on the hook to pay for the repair, and they offered to just unwind the contact and buy it back from me and I accepted. I wish I hadn't, but the roof repair cost more than the entire purchase price of the car ($6000 before extras vs $7000 to replace the roof assembly) and that scared me off the cost of future repairs that I may be liable for.",1684149931,3

2499,SgtBallsack,jjs3hde,t3_13ex9m5,13ex9m5,Did you test it already? I test drove one and the abrupt and slow gear changes made me buy a manual instead. It felt like i got launched into the windshield when it upshifted,1683833842,1

2501,SgtBallsack,jjsbad2,t1_jjs5h7w,13ex9m5,I dont think it was broken. It had 20 thousand km on it and 3 years old iirc. It was the European version which i think has a different gearbox? http://www.fiat500usaforum.com/showthread.php?38661-Abarth-500-gearbox,1683836891,1
2502,volttage,jjrxnav,t3_13euaiq,13euaiq,"Unless the compressor had a horrific internal failure that threw metal chunks into the a/c system, then all I hear from this $3000 quote is *shotgun cocking noises*.

From personal experience trying to source a/c lines for my 2012 coupe, I advise against replacing all a/c components. What Fiat did is have R134 systems in the early cars, then on the 2015- updated cars, they changed the system to 1234yf, and subsequently discontinued a lot of the a/c lines for the early cars. Fiat classic couldn?€?t even help me get the right discharge line, the part just didn?€?t exist anymore. So now my car is a bastardized a/c system with one hose that is off a 2015 car, and has the high side port that is 1234yf, and a low side that is r134. It?€?s interesting to try and evac and recharge it now?€?

Anyway, back to your problem. Get the expansion valve, the 8 orings, the a/c compressor, it?€?s 4 orings, a new a/c relay and a fuse if you haven?€?t already replaced that during the diagnosis.  Take it to a reputable a/c shop and pay them to install it. Don?€?t diy this in your garage. I?€?m a former mechanic with access to professional a/c machines. Replacing these parts, then using one of those ?€?recharge cans?€? from autozone doesn?€?t cut it. 

Good luck",1683831549,3
2503,Milnoc,jjtra7q,t3_13euaiq,13euaiq,"Sounds like the people who changed the transmission screwed up. For my 2015 with a manual transmission, changing the clutch requires draining the engine coolant and AC refrigerant. What if they forgot to recharge the AC or pinched a wire?",1683860072,0

I think I?€?m gonna do exactly that, just order the parts and find a good shop to do the work. Seems like having a pre 15?€? car comes with all manner of fun issues :D",1683832221,1
2506,volttage,jju5hod,t1_jjtra7q,13euaiq,"Removing the manual transmission on any US FIAT 500 does not require draining any fluid. Maybe the trans oil if you are worried about spillage out of the open axle holes?€?

The whole a/c system is on completely the opposite side of the engine bay from the transmission. You literally only have to remove the battery and it?€?s tray to get to every nut, bolt, and component you need to disconnect on the top of the trans. Everything else is the axles and bolts on the bottom side.

E: you do have to drain the brake fluid as you need to remove the throw out bearing hose.",1683868055,1
